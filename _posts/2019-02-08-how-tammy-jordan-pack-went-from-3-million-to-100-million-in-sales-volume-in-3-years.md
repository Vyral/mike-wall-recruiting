Recently, I had the opportunity to interview a fellow real estate professional with an incredible story. Tammy Jordan Pack has had her license since 2009, but didn’t found her current company until 2015.

Since that time, Tammy and her husband (with whom she runs her business) have seen incredible growth—going from $3 million to $100 million in sales volume in just three years.&nbsp;

To give you a better idea of how she did it, I’ve made our entire interview available for all of you to see.&nbsp;
