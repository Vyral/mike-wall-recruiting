Today I’m joined by Mary Simmons-Maloney to talk about another important topic: overcoming adversity. Mary will tell us about her own story of overcoming adversity, becoming an entrepreneur, and opening her own brokerage. At the end of the day, the job isn’t always sunshine and roses. Everybody goes through failures in their business, and you know what? That’s okay—that’s what makes makes us stronger.
