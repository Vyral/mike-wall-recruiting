        "content": "Kevin Hoover, a 12-year experienced Myrtle Beach luxury agent talks about his successful shift to EXP Realty, what good does he see with additional passive income generation with EXP and how does he compare the EXP model with the conventional business models.Click here to listen to the podcast. Read the complete transcript below.Mike: This is the agent revolution podcast; the next evolution of the real estate industry.Let’s get started!What’s up it’s Mike Wall, eXp agent and team leader, your host for The Agent revolution podcast. Today I’m excited to chat with Myrtle Beach South Carolina’s old rock star real estate agent Kevin Hoover. Kevin and I dive deep into his personal journey - leading seemingly a perfect life at a local brokerage for this incredible opportunity he saw at eXp realty. Let’s get this thing started!All right all right, man! We are live, ready to rock n roll with Mr. Kevin Hoover, how are you?Kevin: I’m great, thanks for having me, this is awesome!Mike: Yeah, Super excited, not only to have, you know, everybody that hopefully will follow the podcast and the Facebook live get to know you, but to get to know you myself, you know obviously, we were part of this great company here at the eXp and you know we feel like we’re doing some really cool things. And certainly we would invite not only eXp agents but other agents across United States and abroad to be a part of that. So, really, the purpose of this platform is just to provide a kind of an informational session for agents who maybe seeking a better way to do business or just to learn a little bit more about the eXp and then also our eXp coworkers to learn more about each other. And so without further ado, Mr. Kevin Hoover welcome to the show! Why don’t we do this real quick? I don’t want to get a lot into how long have you been into real estate and how you got into real estate, but so want to just touch briefly on that. So, why don’t you just tell in a brief synopsis, how did you get in to real estate, how long you’ve been doing it and then we’ll go straight into our eXp stuff.Kevin: Excellent, excellent! I started real estate in New York City in 2006 about 12 years ago. 2008 came and I got out of real estate abruptly. There’s a lot of people there and they get back in about three years ago, full time. So, it’s been a process of 12 years.Mike: Wow! Ok. Twelve years goes by in the blink of an eye.Kevin: Yes!Mike: So, you were there for tough times.Kevin: Oh, yeah!Mike: Tell me a little bit about that.Kevin: It was a trying time for everybody, I mean, business changed literally overnight for a lot of people, myself included. I was much younger and much more naive at the time and it blindsided me.Mike: Yeah!Kevin: But, on the back side of that, I learned the biggest lessons about business and about real estate, that I probably wouldn’t have learned otherwise. So, definitely it really helped.Mike: It seems like, you know, it’s in the toughest of times is when we learn the most and when it makes the people, who are really dedicated to their craft, those are the ones that ultimately improve because they learn from those lessons. I would absolutely agree with you. So tell me this then, how is your business currently structured? Are you a solo agent?Kevin: Yeah, I’m a lone ranger. I’m a little different than, maybe, a lot of people especially with the eXp. But I know I have no interest in building, you know, a traditional team or anything like that. And so I operate out of my house and on the Cloud, 100 percent solo.Mike: That’s awesome. And that’s a great thing about real estate, it’s the fact that you it’s not the same for everybody. In other words like what I think of as someone to be successful in real estate may not be in alignment with what you think is successful. And what I want to real estate may not be what you want and certainly you know that is the really cool thing. You can do real estate at a high level and be celebrated. You can do real estate at a high level and be, you know, a team. You can be an investing. So there’s so many different things you can do to get from a production standpoint. What was your goal this year?Kevin: To do between 5 and 6 million is my goal for this year. That’s pretty consistent. I got it to the point of doing 10 or 12 but I have a 3 year old son and a wife. I like to spend time with them. So that’s been a priority. So, I kind of reverse engineered to scaling back a little bit. And that’s what I really like about, and not to say we need to be, but that’s what I really like about the model, I can turn it up or down as I need or as I want. So, right now five or six million is my sweet spot is going to wear on me and gives me a lot of time and gives me enough money and I can afford it myself.Mike: Yeah! That’s also me and I would imagine there are a lot of people that are listening to this or watching this and they are right there in that you know, 4, 5, or 6 million dollar range. And that certainly can provide a comfortable lifestyle. You know it you can balance over the life of a career. I mean there’s once went into the spectrum and then there’s other in that kind of falls right into that sweet spot I would especially think so in that South Carolina market where the cost of living isn’t super high, not cheap here in Ohio either. Ok! So, you get that five to six million dollar mark. And so, it’s just you. I wouldn’t say that Myrtle Beach is a luxury market but it is certainly I guess a large portion of it would be vacation homes or second homes and stuff like that, correct?Kevin: Yeah! Very much for a second home market. And really we run the gamut. You know we have you know 50000 dollar condos and then we have you know 10 million dollar homes. Not a lot of them, but that’s kind of the challenge with this market is that the buyers that live here and most of the sellers don’t live here. So, it is so fun to work in and you get to see a big variety from client to client which I really love. It’s not same thing every day.Mike: Absolutely! So, where were you at before you moved to eXp?Kevin: I was working for a small luxury brokerage out here in Myrtle Beach. We were doing a small team of seven people. What I’m doing about project to do about 69 million in sales among those seven people. Do a lot of new development and you know homes and things of that nature. And that really shifted my focus of leveraging my time and how do I do that and what is this cloud based broker saying. Well, you know, how this model works steering away from traditional models where you have an office and you sit on site, you take your turn in the rotation and you go to training and you have meetings, and everything like that. And so the subway from that to eXp was something that I had actually sought out and I said hey I want to be by myself. I don’t really want to go to meetings, unless they’re vital or important or you know I don’t want to sacrifice time for a meeting if I don’t have to. And I don’t want to do the layers of income. And that was what drew me here.Mike: So, I asked this question to everybody and I feel like you know everybody reacts differently when they hear about something. You know, they are early adaptors, there are certainly people that do more research than others. Where you fall into that kind of that gamut. Are you one like when you heard about it, like you knew this was it, and you need to make the change that you heard about it. I mean I’ve talked to some people you know heard about it and they didn’t change for a couple years and I talked to people who heard about it and they immediately moved. So where do you fall in that spectrum?Kevin: I’m kind of middle. I think it took me two months to really go from the first time I heard about it to really entertaining it as my thing. But, I’m reminded, I knew a guy in New York, when I lived there and he was an administrator or something for Google. And in fact for ten years, and he was able to retire with seven figures in the bank because of stock options. And so I was reminded of that story and I thought well you know I don’t want to drag my feet too much on this because I believe and it was just checking a lot of boxes as far as what I was looking for as a company. And so it didn’t take me really very long. I really convinced my wife when we do that I convince myself. So I was telling her all about and everything like that. I think it was very quick after that. I see a lot of people and I see the same thing you do. I’ve seen people take years, people who maybe have a big team, and moving the whole team over. Or they want to understand more about how it works and it takes a little time for that. But I’m very much go at my guy and like a lot of really good things.Mike: So talk about that moment when you first heard about it and in kind of the emotions or the reactions you had and kind of what you went through from that moment when you heard about it and in doing your due diligence and then to moving.Kevin: I got really excited when I first heard about it and I didn’t know enough to know why I was excited. I just knew that I was excited, because it sounded like a really cool thing for me. You know I’m a video guy and I like tech, and I like new things and I’m very much like anything that’s against traditional business. And so this was very interesting to me. And then as I got in and I started to learn about the applications and eXp world and everything that goes along with it. I got even more excited. And that’s not even talking about the income opportunities but you know just the technology and the grouping and how you meet people of your state all over the country. So as I dug deeper, I was like wow! I thought this is really pretty cool stuff that I like to be a part of. And that’s really where it came for me because I was building another business, a coaching business and everything like that. This just fits right into what I’m doing as well as writing and stuff like that. So, it’s just a natural match for me.Mike: Yeah! I didn’t want to touch on that because I did think that was really cool and I didn’t even know this until I started to do a little research myself. But you’re a contributor at Edmunds. How did that work.Kevin: You know it’s funny but I’m a big believer that you know when you meet people you just never know where they’re from. So, I was at a conference in Miami, a coaching conference, a connect with a few people and one of the ladies that I connected with the editors using real estate and I helped her out a little bit I guess. She said she’s connected with the editor over in and if you’re interested, and I was like, surely going to go. And then you have to submit. They don’t just say ok, published. You’ve to submit. So I submitted a piece and she really liked it and published it and then we just kept a really good relationship. It probably lasted 12 to 18 months. And now we’re getting to the point of them actually asking me to do pieces for them. So it’s been really cool. I mean they are such great people at Edmund and my connection there was just like I was looking for. It’s just kind of found me and I ran with it.Mike: Yeah that’s huge. Man! I think that’s great, not only for the articles that you’re producing but also for your own credibility. I mean I think that overflows into you, actually the consumers that you’re working with you. And certainly giving you that authority and that credibility. So, kudos you man, for putting that together, that’s something awesome.Kevin: Thank you! And others point about I was surprised a little bit. But you’re right. I use it to just give me a little bit of leg up when I start chewing an opinion about real estate.Mike: Good for you man. Ok! So, when did you actually move over to eXp?Kevin: It is almost a year to the day it was September 1st last year that I officially pulled the plug over to eXp. And I’ve spent the last year figuring it out, figuring out how it works for my business. This year will be a big initiative as you start building people around me for eXp. So it’s been a great year.Mike: That’s awesome. I’m glad, I love the fact that you have been here for almost a year because I think, I’ve been here since February and I think now you have a year under your belt. You’re able to kind of look back over those last 12 months and say you know here’s kind of what I figured out and obviously so there was that day that you know you decided to move to the moment that you actually move. Now you’re 12 months in. So, talk about like talk about your experience over the last 12 months and what problems or challenges has eXp solved directly for your business if any at all. And then, well first I’ll just let you comment on that.Kevin: When I got in there were 4000 agents. And that’s not a long time ago. I think now there are17000 somewhere around there. So, that that kind of growth that quickly, I knew there were going to be bumps in the road, challenges for us as a company to overcome. And my experience with that is as soon as something comes up, they are right on top. My broker or people that work in that front, all the people that corporate with this company you know all the people that are trying to make this a seamless process have been right on it and they are also seeing opportunities. And I don’t see from the ground level that they present my way and I’m just a while that does make things easier. A lot of things happen with the CRM that is provided. The process of actually the online transactions that guys love, a lot of updates on that have just made things really seamless, going forward to communicate with people. The real challenges that comes since last year. In the end, it is just it’s a matter of understanding that companies that are young, they grow very quickly. Have to have cheerleaders and have that people that are out there, you know, just driving away and going after it. And that’s kind of where I saw my role as you know this is going to work out there. And it’s not going to go downhill and it’s is only going up. I believe that it is for me, I’m just going to do what it takes to help them anyway.Mike: That’s also made. So, the question I like to ask you is that, you know, there comes that day when you say OK, I’m doing it. You say I’m making the change. But then there’s that one little issue, right? You got to tell your broker. And so, I’m always curious because you know for us, we’ve made the change, we’re on the other side of that and we move down the road or that individual who maybe, hasn’t made the change yet, maybe, has a great relationship with their broker. They maybe, even developed a friendship. And so how do we like? What do you say to that person? What advice can you give them? Approach their broker or their manager to tell them? What they’re thinking about doing or what they have already decided to do?Kevin: It’s tough, it is tough and it was tough when I did it and I suspect it will always be tough. It’s a business decision, it just is. And when you make a business choice there are two things that can be involved and when asked to benefit you or your family or your people or your direction, and to be sensitive to someone else’s needs. So, when I decided my business, I wanted to look a certain way. I looked at my broker what he was expecting of me and it wasn’t matching. And so my decision was, it’s not fair for me not to live up to their expectations of what they need out of an agent. And it’s not fair to me or my family for me to try to mold into something that just doesn’t match my life. So I went and I had a very heartfelt discussions, very honest and very open. And I find that to be the best policy that you are moving for a reason and you can explain that reason. And sometimes that explanation is just, I’m sorry!You know, I said, it’s time for me to go. And that’s a valid excuse. For me it was, I could be the agent they needed me to be I could sit on site on weekends, you know, two weeks or months because I had a son play soccer and I had to be there for those. So it just really became out to be where you are going to be fair to me and this is the choice I made. Handshake no hard feelings. I know a lot of people with the eXp, that’s not been that way been. I made a choice because I believe this to be best for me and my business. And that’s that. And then it goes a lot of different ways. I think if you address it from an empathetic standpoint and from a place of, I’m trying to look out for both of us in this equation. But I have made a decision and I am affirming that decision. And there’s nothing but respect and come across the table. It’s all in how you approach it.Mike: Yeah! I find that you know it and it doesn’t happen this way all the time. You’re right! Like I was with Keller Williams and you know we were actually getting ready to open our own market center when we found out about the eXp. And so the only reason I tell you that is because when we went to the group that we were working with, and told them that we decided to move. It was like, well, we’re sending you a license back to the state. And so, we had to hustle like really quickly. They didn’t give us any time to do. I think they handled it poorly. I think they could have handled it better. I don’t think that that’s Keller Williams’ culture so to speak. But culture only goes as far as the people at the brokerage locally. You know what I mean. So clearly I don’t think that they necessarily reflected Keller William’s culture. So, our move was a little more challenging. And so, I think probably somewhere, you know, it sounds like your move was like, if I can necessarily say, that they were in complete support of you leaving. But it sounds like they were like, OK, yeah we get it! And what I found is that if you’ve truly built a relationship with somebody or a friendship and, you know, you’ve decided that this is what’s best for you and your family and your business moving forward. That if it is a true friendship or a relationship that they will support you in whatever decision you make whether it includes staying at their brokerage or moving on to the eXp or any other brokerage for that matter.Kevin: Right? I agree with you 100 percent and I think that was just, you know, don’t get me wrong, I left behind a billion dollars of listening but that was client’s choice. I am working LeDrew market, I wanted to serve in first and I was prepared to take that as giving him a choice of staying with the brand or that company, coming at me and I want to be at eXp. And so there were loans, but I prepared myself to take those loans because that’s just the right thing to do. Not to fight that and not to combat but to quickly regroup and move on. Just of like you did. You know, when you left that’s all we can do right now though.Mike: I want to rewind back a little bit because, you know you mentioned the opportunity to build long term wealth. And I know what you’re talking about there but talk a little bit about what the long term wealth means to you and how that relates to being at eXp?Kevin: It’s really easy for someone of real estate to build a real estate job. And it’s really more challenging to build a real estate business and the way to differentiate those two is if you have to show up every day and nothing happens without you there then you got a real estate job. And if you are able to leverage your time and maybe you have some verticals in your business that create passive income or investment opportunities, then you’ve really geared yourself more towards a business. So with the eXp, we can say that word the revenue share part and the stock options and certainly you know everything that goes into that. It looks like something I was interested in. There was a long play that wasn’t hinging on anyone else other than me doing my job and trying to build a business a brand for myself with eXp in my market. And it just made perfect sense and I got really excited about the opportunity to invest in the company that I work for. First and foremost, because I think that’s important. And then, I also got the opportunity to invest in people and I intentionally waited a year to see how the inner workings worked so that if anyone wants to come into that world then I know a little more and I can help them better. And as far as the culture of the eXp, because there is a very unique culture, and creating my avatar was the coolest thing that I did. But it was a shift you know most people go in and decorate their desk. And I had to go in and pick out a shirt. It was just a little bit. So that’s really how I look at it. It is that three verticals that I use for. Creating long term wealth is obviously selling houses, selling real estate property, the revenue share for bringing people into our company that will succeed and produce, and then also investing back into the company through stock option program.Mike: Yeah! And what’s so great about it and I think why I’m so passionate about it, when I talk to people, is the fact that we’re still doing exactly what we did at Keller Williams. But, now we just added in these two other layers of producing passive income. And I just like profit share was one thing I’ll be completely candid. The biggest profit share cheque I ever got was like three hundred thirty six dollars. And you know being at the eXp, I think the fourth month we were here, I had a check that was ten times of that, I mean, literally in fourth month! So I don’t say that to boast or to brag. I’m just trying to provide some context for that. What we’re talking about what you, and I are talking about the type of opportunity that’s at play here. And so, like you can literally in your own business, move your business over, do exactly what you were doing at your other brokerage and make more income. And that’s not even talking about commission splits or fees or anything like that, right? We’re not even there. And so I think that you know, obviously, hopefully there is that agent out there that is starting to understand what we’re talking about and they don’t want to be a real estate agent for the rest of their life. They don’t want a job they do, they want to create some passive income. And in those are the type of people, I think both you and I are talking to right now. Let me ask you this then, what do you think? So you’re here and now you’ve got 12 months under your belt or almost. What does your future look like at eXp thing, now that the dust is starting to settle for you?Kevin: Right now, that’s funny, you say that because some of that with my wife last night, and I love the way it looks, you know. I think, obviously doing sales has to be the lead of all that for me. So that’s going to be the lead of everything at eXp, selling property, but also helping people build their business with eXp, bringing people into my world and kind of sharing ideas that I have, the experience that I have. It, kind of just becomes this, really great you know, secondary health center, I lack a better phrase. For real life interaction, and since I’m just real, you know from ground zero experience. You know, I think, then you look at the long term you know the option to help clients and other agents and also to communicate and have a community with other likeminded agents. That’s vital and I think that’s where I was drawn the most as I get to talk to people like you, we just agree on the principles of business where we want to go. We saw an opportunity, we saw a vision, and we saw something that was deeper than just going out, knocking on doors or sending postcards or selling you know, 100 properties a year. We saw an opportunity that was deeper than that and it also had exit strategies that had a lot of layers that national businesses have. I just couldn’t find anywhere else, in real estate at least.Mike: It’s awesome man! And so, that agent whose are that broker who is listening to us or watching us right now, who is thinking about you know, making a change or has decided to make a change to the eXp or well, I guess not decided but that agent who knows there’s a better way to do business, let’s just say what is a piece of advice that you could give to that agent about eXp.Kevin: I’ve got a ton of advice about this. I talk to agents and brokers, and I talk to a lot of them daily. I think they over think it. That you know, it’s not a new business it’s just a new version of the model. It’s not a new concept. You know the core principles of real estate are the same no matter where you go, but if you get the feeling in your gut, and normally people know within the first five or 10 minutes whether they want to do it or not. And then they spend a week, to days, a year, or two years even, talking themselves into it or out of it. And my advice is that the sooner you can get to it and convert over and start going forward in your new way, the better. And that’s really where I got to a point. And literally it happened in a couple days where I was like I knew. And then I was like I’m just wasting time at this point. Now I’m really just wasting time. Everything adds up. Everything looks good. Everything is verifiable, everything that I see on paper, I can also see in real life by connecting with other agents across the country. And so it didn’t get to a point. It was kind of like what are you waiting for like you know, it’s like asking to go to dance at the middle school dance. What is she going to say? Yes or no? And you know that right from the start. So it’s probably very bad analogy.Mike: What it’s like? It’s no different than running a real estate business. If you get into real estate you don’t know what you don’t know. But once you start to learn things like lead generation you know, time blocking all those are integral pieces to running a successful real estate business. If you know the men don’t apply them then you know it’s shame on you. It’s like you know when you are going to take action. It sounds like that’s what you did, it’s like once you decided or once you knew that eXp was fit for you then you just knew that at this point you were wasting time unless you took action and moved in. So, ultimately that’s what you did.Kevin: Yeah! My wife and I decided one day, the next day I would talk to my broker, and you know whatever, however much time it the state to get things together, that’s when I was there.But I think that still a lot of agents are looking for something that either says this is different or this is the same. You know, that’s kind of the overthinking part. And you know what it really is, it’s a real estate company. It’s just not your traditional mom. The sooner you can get in the sooner you can explore what it is and continue working and continue building in. A lot of the options that we have with eXp are actually better than most of the other companies.Mike: So it can be on top right?Kevin: Yeah, yeah!Mike: The funny thing is too it’s like, for me, when I when I told you we’re still doing the same thing we did at Keller Williams, it’s just we’ve added these additional layers of passive income opportunity. It’s like you know that is a big piece of it. But man think about it this way. I mean, I know this has to resonate with you because it’s a part of you excited about the opportunity to get in on the ground floor. And we’re still on the ground floor. I mean, you’re 14, 15, 16, 17 thousand agents. When you talk about a company like Keller Williams 170000 agents, right? So, you know the people that I looked up to at Keller Williams who was making over a million dollars a year profit share they all got in early. They got into early like were getting in early so we all see this opportunity right? And we want to be those people at you know in 10 15 20 years, we’re seeing those same type of residuals. And so that that gets me really excited is to be a part of something so special and getting on the ground floor.Kevin: Absolutely, I think that’s the difference in people being a part of the story and reading about the story you know, and it’s all you get. And when you have confidence and when you have faith in it, when you have confidence in yourself to jump over and just work in that thing. I think, every big company that has come across the stock market in the last 20 years has made it big as the early adapters have been the ones who also created the legacy, financially and for the company in long term. You know, it’s remarkable. I’m reminded why my grandfather got the option to buy stock in a region that has a grocery store chain called Food Line. And the guy knocked on his door he lived in North Carolina, not those dorms were selling stock from the small grocery stores 50 cents. And my grandpa said, no no no! And my dad and I did the math you know, paid the guy some money he could have been like. And so I always wanted that it’s like you know, I can’t, he wanted 100 bucks you get that guy a hundred bucks. Fast forward 34 years and that’s also 22 million or something.Mike: Like that wasn’t selling Microsoft’s year.Kevin: So for me this is kind of like that. It’s like OK, I can do the things I’ve been doing already and still make a living. Not worry about it’s not all my livelihood, is not tied to revenue, are tied to the stock options, are tied to anything else. I can still just do business as usual. On top of that I’m adding a couple other things that if I utilize them correctly they can really make a difference in my family’s life.Mike: Absolutely, brother!  Thank you so much Kevin for letting me steal some minutes out of your day. How can people connect with you if they have questions about you know how you run a business or eXp?Kevin: Facebook is good, or e-mailing is good, keving@kevinhoover.com or either one of those would be the best way to get in touch.Mike: Awesome man!

Read the complete transcript below.Mike: This is the agent revolution podcast the next evolution of the real estate industry.Let’s get started.What’s up? I’m Mike wall proud EXP agent, Owner and team leader. Your host of The Agent Revolution podcast for the next 30 minutes. I’ve got an absolutely crazy episode today. I’m sitting down with real estate legend Curtis Johnson. Curtis runs one of the top 50 real estate teams in the country according to The Wall Street Journal. This dude is everywhere and he’s giving us the skinny on his transition to EXP.So let’s get this thing started.Curtis Johnson, the freaking godfather. Dude it is an honor to be sitting down and chatting with you today. So I just wanted to talk to you as I was hoping that you would share your personal and unique journey from where you were to where we are both now which is EXP realty. So first of all, welcome to the show.Curtis: It is an honor for me to be with you. It’s good I’m excited.Mike: Appreciate that brother. How long have you been in real estate now because you were Under 30 guy right?Curtis: I think I got it when I was 29. But yeah. So I’ve been in low and a couple months it’ll be 20 years exactly since I got my license and I started a team after about a year. My first year I sold 10 houses and was beating my head against a wall trying to figure out, scrambling work and every hour possible. As I started to go through, I knew nobody could be working harder than I was. I also knew that I made 24,000 dollars that first year. I knew everybody was making more than I was and there were just things they didn’t know. I just went out and hired the best coaches and traveled all over North America trying to learn from the best people out there and then putting systems in place to start a team that next year and I went over 100 units and we’ve been over a million GCI, several million GCI for like 16 years in a row or something like that but just trying to surround ourselves with great people like yourself.Mike: That’s phenomenal. Let me ask you this, how did you even get into real estate? Well what did you do before and how was the transition process.Curtis: I did a lot of stuff I think. I realized that I’m unemployable. I started working when I was really young. I really had my first real job when I was 11. I had to kind of fake my I.D to be able to qualify because you had to be 12 to be a paper boy. But my step dad worked for the paper. So I started working hard when I was young I just always been working in and doing stuff. I got a real estate when I was 26 and started hustling. I was going to going to school taking a full load. I was working at a financial planning software company giving advice to accountants and financial planners. I realized they didn’t know what they were dealing if they were getting advice from a young punk like myself in helping them try and help their clients out. At the same point I was working a third job. My wife and I were newly married. My wife is an accountant and she was an accountant at a dairy who they had a bunch of land and then they ended up getting a cemetery and then they built a funeral home. They needed somebody with an insurance license. To sell insurance for this stuff and I happened to have one because I was at the financial planning company. I started work in a little bit there and ended up starting a cell Death if you will. I sold funeral plans and actually just finding a way to build, to help people so that in their time in need they didn’t overspend. I did that and then we moved down to Arizona about 22 years ago and I realized, no one is from Arizona everybody is from a different place. It wasn’t something that I was really loving doing that. So I ended up working for a real estate attorney. Doing some odd jobs and things I thought I was going to able to help out. At the end of it, it wasn’t a best situation. He was in his up and up is what I had kind of wanted to do and I realized I’d rather just be on the happy side of this by trying and help people sell houses and I thought “well how hard could it be?”. I told my wife I want to go in real estate. She thought I was crazy. And she said OK we’ll fine we agreed that she was going to give me 90 days and if I couldn’t sell a house in 90 days, I was going to go have to get a real job. I’m unemployable and I knew I couldn’t go back to a regular 9 to 5 job because I was unemployable. I got lucky sold one and got lucky then sold another and now almost between myself, I’ve just got the most incredible team almost really close to about 5000 home sales now over the last 19 years.Mike: Holy cow. What were you guys is dollar volume last year in 2017?Curtis: Last year we were between 50 and 60 million. Typically, we were between 60 and 70 million. I think we’ve done 40 million plus for internal for 15 years something like that I have to go back and look. But you know it. It just kind of it just keep plugging away.Mike: Yeah. No absolutely man. So between 50 and 60 million in 2017. How is your team structured right now? I mean with admin, buying and listing agents how are you structured?Curtis: Pretty standard. I allow agents based on skill to be able to work with buyers or sellers if they’ve got their skill up. Most people start out working with buyers. But at the same point we made a decision a long time ago that if they can get their skill up. I’ve got some automated pieces to it so I can help people that maybe don’t have the skill as high as they want but they still want to be able to work with sellers. So that can go through the process because a lot of people I realized a long time ago that if they only work with buyers and in even though that’s way more efficient and I’m not going to dispute that it’s that if you keep the focus down they’re more efficient but they’re also becomes resentment I found. Then they also lose a lot of listening but because they don’t want to turn them over or they’ve got a friend that is thinking about selling and then sometimes they’ll leave the team because they’re like well. I’d never be able to get this. and so we do make it’s guilt. That if they get their skills up they can go through and work. On site staff, Admin. I just really brought on a recruiter. Full time graphics person, full time video person, knows her off site. I just kind of wander around and try and look busy I guess.Mike: So how long have you been with EXP?Curtis: I just hit six months.Mike: Ok, six months. Where were you before EXP?Curtis: So my journey over the last 18 years or so, I was with ReMax. I was one of the biggest producer in the area with pretty Macs and then I was really enamored with KW. When Gary Keller came out with the red book. The real estate agent not a millionaire real estate agent books just phenomenal book. I wanted to be around people because I know it’s the kind of people who were in the room with who are around people, that are building a business. I knew that he gets me strategies and it is more likely to be able to follow that if I was in that environment. I went over and again at the time, it was the most entrepreneurial company out there the opportunity to be able to buy into a market center or maybe even buy a region. And that was kind of alluring to me. I went over there and I ended up getting about 5 percent. But there was also some politics. I didn’t really love exactly to where I was headed. So I was there for a couple years and then I ended up going to what I believe the top of a mountain is. To go open my own company which I went and did and I ran my own for 12 years, it was just my team and loved it. It was fantastic. I loved Remax, I loved KW and I love having my own. And then I realized and about 12 years I was going fine everything was going good but I might. My lease was coming up and I was looking at what’s the future five years out. And I believe it’s about collaboration and about expanding your reach. I thought we’re going to need to go from 15-18 agents to 50-80 agents and I’m gonna need to get more space in. Then it becomes a little bit trickier to be able to do that. I had a friend in town that had a massive the biggest local real estate company and we ended up making a partnership to go into business together and in came over in and then a year eager to his business from 500 agents to 800 agents and I don’t really take much part in that. I was a teeny tiny part in it but it was good to be apart. I saw the EXP opportunity and I just said this is just too insane to not. Look at and guess I did not want to go. I wanted to find every reason why wouldn’t work. Because it’s sucks having to move to a company I didn’t want to do it. But when you see it you just can’t you know Jay talks about you when you say you can’t unsee it. When you really go through and you think about. What your business can be. It’s impossible to be your best in not be at an unlimited opportunity and I think. It’s the biggest opportunity and real estate. In my lifetime. I know it sounds overstated but it’s definitely the biggest opportunity in real estate right now.Mike: Could not agree more. So are you one of those guys, I had been approached about the opportunity at EXP from some agents in our market who just unfortunately. They didn’t have influence or I just I was for whatever reason I just wasn’t prepared to listen at that time. I had heard about it. I did very minimal research. Kender reached out to me through an e-mail and so I got obviously a little more curious because Kender is who he is and he was one of my mentors from afar since especially had already been in the real estate industry since 2000 or I’ve been full time since 2014 and he was someone I looked up. Were you one of those people about it and then just you brushed it aside and you didn’t pay much attention to it or did you hear about it and then you started to dig in right away?Curtis: I looked at her for a year and people go oh my gosh don’t you wish you had come earlier. Honestly in my situation. I’m glad everything worked out exactly how it did for a few reasons I’ll tell you so. My great friend Brent Goave, he came to me in about October of 2016. I had just barely I told you about that partnership I just barely committed maybe a week before I hadn’t moved over yet. But I committed to it now. I’m a man of my word I said this is what I’m going to do. Few months before that Brent and I we shared a room at a conference and when we’d be speaking or he’d be speaking or something like that. He is the most charismatic guy the most incredible person who I just love to be around. He calls me up and I knew that he was getting a little frustrated with kW and looking for an opportunity not necessarily looking to leave but just looking around and he says. Oh my gosh have you heard about this company EXP and I was like I have never heard anything and I feel like I’m on the cutting edge of stuff. I’m like I have no idea what you’re talking about. And he goes. Alright it goes will you please at least look at this and I said Hey you could be shown up with a wheel barrel full of gold bricks and I’m going to have to turn it down just because I’ve already committed to something I said but I’ll look at it just because I love you and I’m polite and I’ll give you my feedback on it. And we got on a call it wasn’t even it wasn’t even a video to watch. It was a call and he had someone explain the concept to me and it didn’t really resonate with me it was too early. Some like it was it was a lot about the revenue share and it was a lot about. I’ve never been in a company that you’re paid based on just strictly off growth and just a lot of things. It was I could see that it was powerful and I knew actually that Brent was going to crush it. I said Brent here’s the deal. They are so lucky to have you. You are going to explode in that company I go but it’s just not for me right now. It’s just too early and I’m not prepared to go. I’m just not in a position to do that, he loved me all the more. And he goes “hey this is cool. I’m showing it to people”. A year and a half later. I think all the people that he showed I think maybe two or three came over originally. And I think over time the eighth one finally came over. That’s pretty cool. But he showed it to me and then we just stayed in contact every month every few weeks and he went from 5000 to 10000 to 20000. At 30000, he got my attention. You’ve got to be kidding me what’s going on. It wasn’t that I was really looking at how do I stop that treadmill of agents joining my team and then going off either they don’t make it or they do make it. We help them, train them and all of a sudden after 3 years they think they’re geniuses. They no longer need you and they go off to something else and they take your leads and they take everything else and they essentially compete with you in the market. I thought this isn’t good for the team leader because you have to make a decision. You either pour into them or you hold back and I’m not going to hold back. It doesn’t feel good to me.Does it feel good to anybody for them to have to creep around and I want to find something where I could go into business and that even when they were ready to fly, spread their wings and why I could still support them genuinely in love them and help them and have help them be the best they could. So we had that dialogue and then we looked at the turnover rates and I was coming across what it was shown was a third of the turnover rate that most of the abuse I’ve seen the ones I’ve looked at are about 38 percent turnover rate and Remax pretty similar and the ones I saw EXP was about a third of that. The ones that did leave teams in a lot of cases were staying inside people’s growth pattern. It was a win. We started getting pretty deep into that, then right when I was kind of getting deeper into it I hear did Jay’s headed to Florida to go look into this and I go oh this is great because Jay’s either you know gonna get somebody really drunk and they’re going to tell him the truth that this is a fraud or he’s going to figure out if it works. I figured he’d find enough flaws in it. I would just build to put it out of my out of my mind I have to deal with it while he’s there and while he’s flying back East, we’re blowing each other up and he’s like dude this is legit. So we really started going down that path, then I think about two months later. You know we converted over and it’s just been an absolutely incredible experience. I pinch myself feel like the luckiest person in the world the most incredible opportunity I could have ever dreamt for and I’ve been praying for this for about 20 years and it finally came.Mike: That is awesome man. OK. So let me dive into that just a little bit because I want to talk to you a little bit about the psychology. Let’s say you’re talking to Jay on the plane. Jay is flying back from Florida and he’s telling news like dude this is legit. So at that point, what were you thinking?Curtis: I got it and I started seeing it. I feel like I’m really bold and brave and at the same point. I was like I don’t want to do this. This is too early in my mind. I don’t want to be that guy that jumps from a company that I just barely a year before. I have my own company for 12 years. It wasn’t like I was like every six month bouncing around. At the same point I saw the offer too. I knew it was where I was eventually going to go at that point I just wasn’t sure about the timing. But I knew that when I went I was going to go big I was going to go in and I knew to do that. I know the power, I’ve watched I’ve been involved in technology companies and I knew that. A lot of the technologies like boomtown Tiger commissions and all these different ones. A lot of them were tiny fledgling things and a lot of my friends, we got involved with them and they just they took off because our industry loves celebrity agents and I hate to say it a different way but they love to see agents that are producing a really high level and they and they flock to him because we’re always looking for the solution. We’re always going well. What are the results. And I want to follow people are getting the results. And so I knew that if I was come in. I was going to go get in a fight. I was shown up with the biggest, baddest dudes could find and we were gonna go win and that we were if we’re gonna go we’re going to bring everybody here. So then I started making a couple calls to people and a couple they were kind of peeking around at it and we all kind of went through a process of looking at it and trying to go well. Where’s the holes, then after a while you start going well what if there aren’t in the holes what fits. What if it’s just the easiest and the smartest thing to do. And then it was about well fine maybe in April I’ll go and then it was you know the end of January was like well I can’t wait any longer I just have to do this.Mike: You got it. Perfect. Then you made the decision. OK so you’ve got this team. You’re thinking about, how do I tell everybody or how do I approach everybody or had you already gone to your team members or at least your team leaders and in kind of pitched the idea. How did that work?Curtis: No I hadn’t. I’d kind of gone through one of the things I’ve realized is you know it’s fun to talk about ideas and a lot of times I’d like to talk about what people my team but I can distract the heck out of them. Right. You bring up an idea and then they just you I guess if people on my team thought oh my gosh he’s gonna go to a different company or do like. Production would stop right. Just like everything would stop him like I can’t do that. I was going through doing my homework doing my due diligence study and watching you watching every webinar I could find 12 times when I got the millionaire real estate agent book. I read that 12 times. It before they came out with the audio. I read it on cassette tapes. I’d sit down and listen to it because I wanted to internalize it. I went deep in trying to figure out what are the solutions.Then it was about how do I go about this? then I was talking to bring it into Jay. How do I do it and then it was kind of getting weak again, it was like well what if what if my team doesn’t come? I still need income. I’m getting older and here I don’t know if I want to rebuild in and start from scratch. And Brent Goave just said “Here’s the deal. You need to get to the point that if all those 20 people on your team walked out and said no. Good luck”. We’re not going that you would go anyways. And I go Well I’m just not there. And it took about another week or two. Around Christmas time a little after Christmas I was like you know what. I love my team I love them to death. At the end of the day this is the best thing for them. And it’s a best thing for me. They might not get it. Some will and I figured I’d end up with about three or four people that would end up coming with me. But I was like it’s the best thing for them and the best thing for me. And they just made that decision. And then when I made that decision I just she shared it with them. And. All but in all but like two people came and one. But pretty much everybody came. And it’s just been a really good experience and a good right to be able to go through it.Mike: That’s awesome man. I appreciate you being open about that. I think that is a probably a common fear of anybody that’s running a team at this level is that you know if I make that change you know first of all is everyone going to come with me. And you know secondarily is how is that going to impact my business if they don’t. So you know kudos for you and I took a very similar approach and unfortunately when we told Keller Williams that we were moving over yet that that wasn’t a good it wasn’t a good thing for you. wasn’t it? I know they immediately sent our license back. They made it very hard and I don’t believe that is who Keller Williams is. Unfortunately, I just think it was more to do with the staff at our particular KW.Curtis: Yeah it worked out great. You don’t think that way. One of the things I would say is that I agree. I don’t think that is the KW culture but I think that that shines a light on one of the problems and why the EXP so attractive is because as much as KW is a company. Each individual, each franchise individually run in. You’re dealing with individual politics every five miles.Mike: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. So when you approached your team to talk about it. How did you do that? Did you go to your team leaders? Did you group everybody in a room and say hey guys who are going to be? How did that work out for you?Curtis: I took to couple leaders that have been with me for about 12 years or so I took them to lunch and they knew I was I searching for answers right. We’re trying to figure out what’s that. You know I’m like what’s the best thing I’m always looking for what’s the best thing not like to jump but like what’s the next best opportunity. I’ve been in that business long enough and things change all the time and I laid it down. I said hey Here’s the vision. I said in the vehicle to be able to get us there it is EXP. That’s where that’s why we need to go. One of them was on board immediately the other one was a little bit more skeptical but he is like “hey, I’ll go with you no matter what”. So I thought even if I just have those two guys I’m good to go. All I can do it can build. I can build fast enough to replicate it and I’m good to go with that. I didn’t still want everybody but that’s where I was right to go because I knew that this was the best thing for them and that if I could relate that in a way then most would come. I wasn’t even sure most would come but I knew that the ones that wanted to be there. Those are the important ones. So then I went to admin, spoke to them. I had my admins and my team leaders and I’m going to present this in a way that hopefully everybody sees it. This isn’t just an opportunity for me. This is everybody has that even if they’re on a team cap, everybody has the same opportunity. Before I could not from stock in the company I couldn’t offer you a savings plan. I couldn’t confirm stuff at 20 percent off. I couldn’t able to offer those types of things to them. It is an opportunity for them to build revenue and put me a passive sources and to be able to do that and then I got everybody once I planned. We got them in a room and presented it and said “This is what we’re going to do”. I said “if you want to stay here our current place. You can do that. I’ll make it. I’ve got a sweet deal set up for you to stay. If you want to come, I got a sweet deal for you there and I’ll love you all the same. No matter what. I’m okay the way”.Mike: So I love that man. So ultimately it just it was about them and I think it’s what I’m hearing you say is once you realized that this is a better opportunity for them it became actually easier for you to then make the decision to move to EXP. Is that what I’m hearing?Curtis: I would even say I felt at my core. I felt obligated. I felt that even if as most people on a team just had their head down and their hustling and running and they’re so busy working and doing stuff they don’t see the opportunity. So I knew that most of them wouldn’t see this as a big opportunity for them. They would self-discover it over the first 6 or 18-24 months. They would wake up to it eventually. I thought most some aren’t going to see it. I knew at my core; it was the best thing for them. I would be mad if I was on a team and a team leader had a chance to come and give me a bigger opportunity and didn’t come and didn’t tell me about it. It might sound a little weird but I felt like a moral obligation. It was morally reprehensible to not come.Mike: That makes perfect sense. OK. So I want to I want to rewind just a little bit and go back to something you said earlier about what really just boiled down to recruiting and retention. Right so you have these agents you teach them everything you know they come in they have success. Then they go off and sell real estate on their own and they compete against you. So talk specifically about EXP has helped you in that regard.Curtis: It’s a great question. You know end it’s been real so in the last six months. You know again. I’ve lost a couple agents but I’ve also had a couple that I could change a toilet paper and I’ll lose 30 percent of the people my cup and my team. And that’s across the board and it was anything you could you could change the color from. Off white to cream on your logo. And you know agents are going to use as an excuse to tell us just what happened especially in Arizona. It’s probably the biggest transient real estate market in the world with 40000 local real estate agents that are constantly being told that the grass is always greener and they bounce around not making any money. So it’s going to happen and it hurts but that’s just kind of the way it’s going to go. It’s also a bigger opportunity and I had a couple of people on my team. Three in particular that came here that probably that all said they wanted to stay on my team and actually maybe back up a little bit. Even when I presented test it was a couple people that Id interviewed with EXP. They didn’t know where they talk to people about it A couple of them were investing in EXP and I’m like crap, I had no idea. I was probably going to lose them at some point to EXP anyways if I didn’t come. But when I over the last six months I’ve helped a few of them say “hey this is great I love the EXP. I love you” and in a different world they would left. They would have gone to Home Smart or a KW or Century 21 or coal banker or something. But they said “hey I want to stay here and I want to build a team”. I want to be able to do this. I want to build a present this. I said you’ve got my blessing, let me help you do that. I could continue to pour into them. It much more even more and help them grow. One in particular I think he’s got about seven or eight recruits, four or five on the books I think. But he’s got like several more that he’s bringing on another one has gone off and he’s got two or three agents recruited. And so it won just barely this last week we’re helping him transition out until it puts me in a better spot. Not that I don’t want people on my team but it puts me in a spot that I can say I’m going to give you guys everything I’ve got and when it’s time whether I agree it’s time or not it’s immaterial. It’s kind of like someone in the MBA that they might have are in college, they might have played one year. Maybe they think they’re amazing and they get to get drafted and we tried given the best advice we can. Right. And when they think it’s time for them and they want to go spread their wings they’ve got my blessing and I’ll help give them everything. Everybody in our group and our honey badger group and they get all that they get me still to help consult with them. It just brings a lot of value and actually makes them feel more confident in going on their own. More confident in building something bigger. And I feel like I can give more and help them have a bigger life.Mike: Yeah that’s good. The thing about it is and what I started to realize too is that in really a message that I want to relay especially to other team leaders. Who are listening is the fact that. You know when you’re making a change if you like when I went back and talked to my people Curtis most of them said hey you know. I would go with you if you weren’t to real estate company I started to find that most people were loyal to me and to what I provide, the value that I provided for their benefit. And it’s funny because we don’t. The first thing we’ve been. He goes as team leaders is that so if I move companies. All these people may leave me in what we don’t realize is the fact that most of them in fact are with us because of the value that we’re already providing. And it wouldn’t matter what company you were with. It was only an added benefit that we were moving EXP and being able to provide more value than we could ever provide at any other company.Curtis: Absolutely I agree hundred percent.Mike: So where do you see this whole EXP thing going and we’re what we just crossed the 12000 barrier a month ago?Curtis: I think 13000 or so now I think so and I remember. When I was really looking at this back way back like seven-eight months ago. We were talking about what the future holds for EXP and stuff like that. The idea was wow, what we think. I think at the time it was like 4500 people in the company and it was wow. If everything goes right at the end of 2018 we might hit 12000 agents. And I was like So you’re telling me we would triple in the next like 14 months or whatever it was like that’s just nuts. we’ve already hit it in June or so we hit that already. So you know now we’re looking at okay we’re probably going to get to 20000 agents. This year and then it probably double again in the next nine months after that.Mike: Wow. So how big can it get?Curtis: You know my gut; I think it’s going to get to 250000 in North America. Even that just boggles my mind. I truly believe that’s what’s gonna happen. I’m talking to Brent Goave. And he said something shattered my mind. When I mention him because this is so new for everybody, we’re just blazing trails, we’re just looking at it. He said “hey there’s 12 million real estate agents in the world. We just need to get two million of them”. I look at the massive revenue stream and the massive stock and everything else and how much fun this is. I’m having the most fun, I’ve ever had in 20 years. And we’re over 13000 agents. Talking about getting to 2 million. My mind can’t say it’s like how many stars are there I can’t even comprehend it. I don’t know, It’s too much.Mike: I can hear your voice. It is always a pleasure to talk to you. I’ve got one more question here before I let you go. So yeah. What would you tell that agent that broker that team leader who’s listening to this right now, what would you tell them if they were thinking about making the move to EXP or any other company? What would you tell them? We kind of encourage them to make a move.Curtis: I don’t know if I can talk about any of the results we’ve had or anything over the last six months. I feel like I’ve been the luckiest guy in the whole world in people joining in stuff like that but I can tell you looking at it. When you’re on the outside and you look in first of all if you can sell real estate you can sell it anywhere. You can sell it. You can sell it at Coldwell Banker, Century, you can just sell it. You can sell it anywhere. You can have your own company. That’s not going to change that much. It’s about. Who or what rooms you can get in who you can surround yourself with business associates, people to partner with you. What kind of training and types of things you can take going forward. That’s everybody is going to be able to get commissions. It’s about are you going to add the other two legs of the stool so you have a three legged stool with some stability in and having stock and most agents don’t have that and they’re not paying their taxes. So you add that in with the stock component of it and then you add in the revenue share that passive income if you’re not buying a bunch of investment properties every year. You need the revenue share and I can tell you looking on the outside it looks like fantasy numbers. I was hoping. To buy at the end of the first year to get to five thousand dollars a month because I thought “Hey, that will make my wife happy” and she’ll leave me alone and realize it’s kind of at least it works the whole time I was with KW. I got less than 500 dollars the whole time. My first revenue share check with the EXP was 1800 and you don’t win in six months. Now it’s into that 20 almost 30,000 thousand a month which is just nuts. It seems nuts looking on the outside it doesn’t seem real. Yeah but I can tell you it’s more real than anything else out there. And it’s the most fun. And you get a hang out with awesome superstars like you Mike. It is just a blast man.Mike: That is awesome dude. Well listen it has been such an honor to have you on the show. I know you’re a busy dude. You’re setting the world on fire.

Read the complete transcript below.Mike: This is the agent revolution podcast, the next evolution of the real estate industry.​Let’s get started.It’s go time, I’m back with another episode of The Agent Revolution podcast another week and another great guest. Today I’m chatting with Mr. Carlos German one of the top agents in Orlando Florida. Mr. Disneyworld himself as always I’m your host proud EXP mega agent and team leader Mike Wall. Carlos is going to let us look behind the curtain of his recent EXP transition. We’re going to talk about how he closed the doors on his brokerage to join EXP and how he got fired from his team. So let’s get started.Hey ​Carlos. Welcome to the show I’m so excited to be here with you brother. Listen we are on this journey to EXP together and it’s really exciting for me to have you on the show today. We don’t know each other really well.​We are acquaintances from some really good mentors in the real estate world. I’m excited to connect with you to get to know you today and get to know more about your journey from where you were to now being on EXP.Carlos: My pleasure Mike and thanks so much for having me on your podcast. Appreciate it. Yeah. Any chance I get to connect with people like you like minded individuals who are doing big things in the industry. I can’t pass that up. You guys just sent us an opportunity.Mike: ​That’s awesome man. Hey let’s dig right in. Help me out. How long have you actually been in real-state?Carlos: I got my real estate license in 2005 so it’s going to be 13 years in December of this year. So it’s about twelve and a half years.Mike: So, twelve and a half years. Man almost a baker’s dozen there. That’s awesome and so I’m curious when you started out into real estate. First of all, how did you make the decision to go into real estate. What were you doing prior to your career in real-state?Carlos: I was seen in the tech field. I used to be a network manager and web developer. This firm that managed networks for small businesses. So that’s kind of what I was doing. That was my first love computer technology and I got pretty good at it and got to lead the teams and things like that. I was the main guy but I wasn’t being rewarded for my efforts to the extent that I thought I deserved or at least was a move isn’t moving as fast as I would have liked. I just felt I had a lot more potential so I started looking into other options. My family had always invested in real-state and stuff like that. That was always kind of an interest of mine and we actually used to live in Maine up north when all these happened. I used to work for this firm over there but we used to come to Florida a lot. I’m from Orlando Florida. That’s where my real-state career started and everything. Now originally from the Dominican Republic. That’s why I had the terrible accent. So you guys are paying attention closely as I understand everything but we used to come to the Orlando area a lot. Through that process I became interested in the Orlando market as a real estate option and actually went for my classes during a Christmas vacation that I was here in Florida. I went ahead and did my classes. But I didn’t take that test until two years later.I see you waited the whole time in Florida you have two years to actually test out before your class expired.  I took the test got my license and then I waited another year to actually get it started. So I am going to date a little bit myself but I was actually 18 when I took my classes.  Yeah. Started my realistic career when I was 21.Mike: ​Wow. OK. Like I said when we were talking before. It’s like everybody’s got a unique story to tell and I’m always interested to dive into that part of everyone’s life because everyone is driven into the industry differently. So at some point it sounds to me like. You knew there was a better way. So you were in tack. You were doing something that you loved and that you were passionate about. You just knew that there was more out there for you. In other words, you knew that for your efforts you could develop something and do it on your own and probably do it at a higher level.Is that correct?Carlos: ​That is correct. I’ve always had an entrepreneur mindset in a sense. I’ve seen it from high school and whatnot. I was I was trying to think as an entrepreneur. I built a Web site out and sold products and stuff like that online which Krischer born. I did a few other things online that didn’t work out so I always had my entrepreneur mindset and I knew that in the tech feel in that hour not that I was 18. I either had to start my own company or do something else and real estate. It was amazing because I saw unlimited potential, massive leverage. I would be compensated for my work. That’s why I was so powerful and so attractive, I took the risk and I’m a risk taker and I moved down to Florida after I got my license and everything I moved down saved a little bit of money and I started realistic full time at that point because I absolutely knew there was a better way for my career.Mike: ​Yeah. So now you’re 13 years in and out. It’s funny because we all get into the industry for different reasons but once we get into the industry it seems like we all learn the same lessons as just we learn them at a different time.So, looking back now 13 years, what are some of the things that you’re most proud of?Carlos: Well I mean for me building my team it was a lot of hard work and I surround them with the right people like Jake in there. Michael Ray is that you know they need a organization. Now I understand some people listening to this are trying to get to 30 and whatnot and I get it. That was amazing for me when I John my first year only sold four houses. So figuring out to get from four to eight then going to 30 and then plus was amazing. Breaking through from there to doing 150 transactions and this year two hundred eighty or so transactions. It definitely brings me joy to know that I’ve built something that is valuable to other people not only to me, he’s not only giving me a career but he’s giving an opportunity to other agents or staff members and whatnot. So I’m definitely proud of the fact that I was able to create opportunities for others not just for me.Mike: ​Love that man. So how is your team structured today?Carlos: Excellent question so that’s where we have to elevate it to the EXP part. What we’re doing with that because it is definitely changed from the way it was to the way it is now and because now it can impact more lives and help more people than partner with so many more other individuals. So before EXP it was a team of buyer agents as a 6 Buyer agents 2 listing agents. I have one admin that kind of the day operations person myself. So that’s the team structure. That’s got a main structure of the team.Mike: Okay perfect, that is what gets me really excited because you’re right. The whole thing I came from Keller Williams. The whole time I spent probably the last 12 months and maybe it was longer than that but it seems like 12 months talking about expansion. When you’re talking about expansion you’re talking about taking what you do in a local marketplace and then expanding that out to different cities and different hubs. Basically taking what you do in your hub city and in just transplanting out into different cities and then getting different people to use your systems for operations and an end in duplicating that in different cities right. That gets me. We don’t talk directly into that yet but I see where you’re going with that because when you talk about the opportunity through EXP with revenue sharing stuff. That’s an exciting conversation but why don’t we first let’s talk about. I ask everybody does this. This is one of my favorite questions so tell me exactly what happened when you first heard about the opportunity at EXP?Carlos: Well I mean that was say an interesting thing because I’m part of a master mind and I have been for many years. I’m a guy who doesn’t like to dabble into a lot of things. I like to go deep. So I pick someday here and I master it as best as I can. So in a year that’s what I did I decided to first I bought one of their programs then I did group coaching and then I did a one on one coaching. From there I went on to the mastermind level. I went very deep in their organization and made some great friends, relationships. So one of those friends is Al Stasek is with mastermind for years. Mastermind is a very transparent environment. You know when I saw mine in so I know Al Stasek. You know I know how big key is how many agents are most revenue. All the expenses while he does everything based on the master mind environment. And then one day I see on Facebook that. He partner with EXP, merged with the EXP Realty and I was like “What’s going on here?”. I know this guy is an independent broker just like me and he’s crushing it. I know he does very well. He had multiple companies. I mean is a very successful individual. I was like what’s going on? Why does this feel about. And. You know I’ll kind of put it out there but he really wasn’t necessarily. Trying to recruit anything or talk about it, I got busy than really looking to it and ended up there. You can ask like he didn’t call anybody me. Some people called him. Because that’s what happens. You know those that are like really big. Whoever makes the jump and partners with the EXP, you’re going to get some calls. Some people called him I didn’t because I was too busy. Body stayed in the back of my mind and then a few months later I was like “Man I want to talk to Al about why he did that?” Again I got a little bit busy and in another month he was going to be our next mastermind which was in October. So I said “I’m going to ask him at that time”. I knew he was anything bad because he was raving about it and obviously if he says I just did. There’s an item about our call. I was meant to help with anything. I stay happy for you my friend Bob and when I saw him in October that’s when I tried to get a little bit more information but initially the first thing and the first reaction for me was curiosity. And kind of wondering why. Such a successful person as an independent broker would do such a thing. However as you know we get so busy with the day today we don’t look into it and there are many people listening to his podcast today that are in that boat listening to us talk about it they’re listening to people talk about it or make the move. Nigerians are the top agents around the country. They are really not looking into. They haven’t seen it. They haven’t taken the time to actually be open minded and take a look at it. And until you do that. You were just wondering why we’re all doing it.Mike: ​Right. That’s so interesting because I’ve always wonder I’m talking to a girl today who is actually a very successful Keller Williams agent and the one thing that’s always intrigued me is that there are people like us who we hear the idea and we do our due diligence and if it makes sense we just make the change right. Then there are people that are on the opposite end of the spectrum and their narrative is change is hard and so there’s everything in between. So when we’re as doing this podcast today. This is a platform for the people that are at the other end of the spectrum and everybody in-between. To just say “hey listen we’ve made the jump”. We’ve taken the plunge. The dust has settled and we’re so much more excited about the opportunity. Now on this side than even we were on the other side when we were first shown this opportunity. For me that’s why you can hear my voice and I can hear it in your voice like we wake up every single day and I’m excited about EXP I’m excited about my team. I’m just excited about life and what we’re doing and you know that’s the whole mindset thing between like the early adopter and the late adopter. At Keller Williams where I came from you, there are some people that were early adopters and I’m not going to mention any names but they are people at our market center that we’re making a million dollars a year in profit share and they were the people that got in to Keller Williams early.​So the opportunity now for us EXP is just like that opportunity Carlos and I’m sure you see the same thing. We have an opportunity to be early adopters to make whatever we want to make whatever we are willing to give for revenue share. I can hear that with you I think that’s really cool.You heard about it in October. When did you actually make the move?Carlos: ​Right. So you know obviously initially June was when I heard about this company. I did not know anything about it and actually it’s interesting because I actually clicked on a link that Al shared. There was a press release about the company. So I look today I was a cloud brokerage I actually went on the Web site as well. I looked a little bit bot. But I was out looks cool grey. I definitely want to learn more about it later. So whatever I kind of pay down. Asking hey Al what’s going on with this company that you merge with. You know what’s happening. And he said “hey you know we’ve been trying to solve these problems for all these years for are business models and I feel like I found the solution for all those challenges. That’s why I made the move. And I was like “Tell me more about it. Like no I can’t tell you know in this environment I mean it’s our master mind. We can talk about it later. I was like okay man but why not let me know what’s going on. We set some time later, he was kind enough to kind of filling a little bit later on the details. It was interesting because he shared it with a few of us. Some people were excited. Some people were completely negative about it. I was just open minded. Like a person that was kind of negative pointing, negative things about it like this stock back then was not in the Nasdaq, so that was a sticking point. This stock is not good enough or whatever. I said “Well we’re not, we’re getting stocks we’re at right now. So that’s kind of a moot point. I was kind of neutral in the sense self. I was up in mind I was just open to listening. Now could this stock solve the retention problem? Possibly. That could definitely help especially for the top producers are the ones that we usually tend to lose in the tech model. So I was open minded to like yeah that could be a solution for that challenge and oh man we’re spending thousands of dollars in tools that month for lead generation and transaction attachment and all these things stand out while this could be a solution for that. Then ultimately for retirement plan and for agents an opportunity to have received all income if something happened to them or in our day just one to retire. It did solve challenges that we have been trying to solve for you in three years. Now. Ultimately when Alvey show me the numbers does too and I was blown away you know when I saw the numbers of the opportunity for people like you and me. That’s when I thought when I say people like you I mean the people that care about. People that are excited about it. People that wanted to share the excitement and the opportunity. They’re going to reap the benefits and it doesn’t take a lot of the work to do it. You can have you’re selling 30 houses a year. Well talk about it to those three agents you’re Trump properties. You know 10 times a month. Well that’s a hundred plus properties hundred plus agents that you could be talking to. If you’re excited about it and you do it as part of your ongoing selves business you’ll get some people who want to leave calm with you I’m with doors and I don’t want to take advantage of the opportunity and that’s when the magic happens.Mike: Yeah. You know it’s so interesting that you said that because I mean there are there so there’s so much to dig into there. But one thing that resonates with me is that. You know it is such an exciting story to tell if you’re selling a product. Let’s just say you’re selling something and you’re just not excited about it, it’s just a job. Your customer sees that and it’s totally different when you actually are passionate about something. You’re putting in front of a potential customer a client or another agent in this particular instance because it’s such a great thing if you can just help them see it. Then there’s really no reason why they wouldn’t join because I mean let’s face it it’s the best idea we’ve seen maybe ever in real estate and obviously we’re excited about it. So we feel compelled to get the message out to other agents.Carlos: Absolutely. That’s really all it takes. I have one of my team members here he is. Talks about it once a week like he is very organized so he’s like you know I’m only going to reach out to people in 30 days. That’s his thing. And he only thinks about it on Thursday. And he’s growing he’s attracting agents. So it really you that decide you want to make of it. It’s not that complicated if you write down you the people that you interact with during the week on Thursday morning and say OK I call this guy I was nice to him My dear to deal with this guy. He loved me. I’ve met this person at a networking event. Great. And then you make you know 6 calls on Thursday. And if they’re open to listen to an opportunity you share with them. I mean does really. So, yeah. I mean you’ve got to that’s why a magic happens. Yeah that’s it. That’s when the magic happens.Mike: Okay so you heard here’s the timeline then you heard about it in June. You were just busy you really didn’t have time to revisit it until October when you drove in with al out at mastermind learned more and then when did you join?Carlos: All right so I was an independent broker so at that time I started kind of my research and due diligence process and a lot of us do that. And you know my mind was made up. Here is what happens to a lot of people. In this story you know that’s kind of what happened to Jay. That’s what’s happening to a lot of people I’m talking to. They say they know it’s amazing. They’re just like okay I get to validate all this stuff because it’s too good to be true. So in this case I met with somebody this week. That is OK. If everything that you showed me is a real sin bright. Okay. Just do your research. You know so that’s where I was like. Man this is for real. It’s a no brainer. You know this is definitely the best opportunity I’ve ever seen in the business. So I started doing my due diligence doing my own research and. Then I shared it with my team individually. You know so I went over it with them individually one by one and got their feedback and they were like know you know this is so people were very excited about it and some people were like hey you’re really there what you do is fine you know. And hey I was happy to hear both answers you know. So. Ultimately we decided to make the move in November but being an independent broker it took me a little bit of time to make that transition. I mean we had over 30 deals on their contract a bunch of listings. So officially we launched in the second week of January.Mike: Me and that is one thing I don’t want to gloss over here though is especially for other team leaders who are listening is the fact that you went to each one of your team members individually because you know you wanted to ensure that you cared about the transition. How would it affect them? But even more so about the opportunity that it would provide for them.Carlos: ​Absolutely. ​It was as much about the impact that we can make in their lives and the lives of every other age and we come in contact with us. It was for me as a team leader, the great thing that I have. So hey you know solves challenges for everybody. I just wanted to validate that assumption. I wanted to validate that some child, I had raised. People are by me and they told me just. Show them the Webinar. Don’t say anything like “hey check this out”. Don’t put your opinion on them or force anything on them. Just having give you fit back. Doesn’t just what I did and it worked out great and I’ve moved forward with my entire team except for one agent that was brand new. I chose my newest agent and fortunately for her. It didn’t work to to make the move because there is a fifty dollars a month fee that I wasn’t charging so fully transparency. She told me and a new agent she just didn’t want to pay the 50 dollar per month fee. I mean certainly their staff saw that you I unfortunately just feel the opportunity. It was seen there with that new agent for me to want to have sort of that.Mike: ​Yep. Same thing for us. Man we transitioned over. I had it roughly about 15 agents at the time and we lost one as well. Who just decided to stay where we were at which we were fine with them we understood because the opportunity is not for everybody. It’s not and it’s for those people who get it. It’s those people who ultimately bought into the vision of what EXP could provide and then ultimately what our team could provide. As I said we came over in February and we haven’t looked back a day since. So happy we made the move. So you told your team. You decided to move out. It was a full launch as you said in January.Carlos: Yes, we know the second week of January we announced it. That was interesting because we had to make a decision as far as the growth of the team itself because we had a lot of people wanting to join the team. This thing attracts like a magnet and is very powerful and we had to decide. We want to help a lot of people. I didn’t want to grow the team be on. I could to providing lead generation and support. I ultimately felt blessed because I have more people to pick from without even having to recruit. I wanted a new buyer agent or somebody for the team environment. It was just unbelievable. We tripled in size within a few months and we haven’t looked back since as you said this month alone is going to be our biggest month. We’ve crawled to nine new agents in our group. So it is very powerful and I believe the fall in Monte would be bigger than that because it just keeps it is, when you give an opportunity to everybody. That is a set in for everybody involved. You’re going to get people that are as excited as you are about it. Where before, as a team leader there you’re the only one excited about growth. The aging is right about selling and that’s it. Well now these people are excited about helping the company grow because they benefit. And you know if you want to grow your team massively. Well they’re super excited about helping you grow your team massively.Mike: Yeah it is expansion on the grandest scale and what I mean by that is coming over from KW Where you know that was the latest and greatest thing that they were they were teaching and coaching about is expansion into multiple locations. We talked about what that was a little bit earlier. What you do from your HUB and duplicating that into deeper marketplaces and in the beauty, the brilliance of what Glen has created here is that you can expand into different marketplaces.You don’t necessarily have the same risk because the only thing that you’re doing is you’re generating and you want to help them. You don’t necessarily have to take your business into a different marketplace and take all the risk that comes along with that and all the expense by the way. But you succeed through agents and you’re not necessarily taking anything from them in terms of a commission split but you’re actually giving to them and you’re encouraged to give to them because through revenue share at EXP you’re rewarded. So the more you give the more you get. It is such a brilliant model and you can do that Carlos just like we have with any agent in the country.Carlos: Yeah, that is amazing. I mean. It’s just awesome. We have the opportunity to do then as you said is fun as us. I mean it’s just amazing. I’ve never been this excited in my 12 years. I don’t remember. It’s interesting because like I don’t ever remember. I’ve had some very big highs. I’ve done a lot of things that have been. You know very big moments for me and building to those moments and building my team. Renting a bigger office and hiring employees and all of these things was great and I kind of have fun doing it. I can tell you that this is fun. It’s just such a big opportunity. I mean it is just amazing. This line is just thrilling super fun, super exciting getting to wake up every day and knowing that hey in all your power something unbelievable.Mike: Yeah absolutely. So you know in our wrap this up just a couple questions so at the end of the day I mean so What drives you. Why do you do all this?Carlos: ​Absolutely. You know for me it’s very simple. I just want to be the best that I can be. That is in every area of my life. You don’t want to be the best father, the best husband, the best leader, the best mentor the best and health person that I can be the most productive. You know I just want to be the best that I can be unleash my full potential. To unleash that is helping me grow and lead them bounds as a leader, as a person, as a mentor, as a coach which is helping me in so many more lives than I could before. It’s just allow me to give more, to be more and to do more. I have ever been able to do so is this continuing in that path and feeling it every single day waking up. Being a better version of myself in every area.Mike: Well said my friend well said so last question. ​What would you tell that agent or that broker listening to this podcast right now?  That are on the fence about making the move to EXP.Carlos: To get clear on why they’re on the fence and then one day get clear. Is it fear? I mean success is always on the opposite end of fear and if you keep being afraid. The person with the right mind set needs to overcome fear in order to grow. There is no other way around it. That’s what stops a lot of people either that if they are on the fence. Concern and fear over something so get clear what that is and get the answers on and get it done. I’ve never seen a company attract so many credible top producers, high level individuals at once so quickly in my entire life and career. Like I don’t know how much more credibility you know you want. I mean this is just the level and the caliber of people being attracted to speed. You know it’s unbelievable. So just reach out and get your answers. Clearly there is something unique to you. I mean EXP has attracted all sorts of agents and variety. So there’s nothing that agent could be going through that we haven’t seen. It is just a matter of racing, getting clear on what that is limiting belief or what a concern is. Then ultimately finding somebody who did it. That kind of explain and that’s the great thing about our community and the by that we’re all helping you show there we’re all partnering with his show there. You know like you said we know each other very well. Here we are helping each other linking arms, master minding, sharing ideas and supporting each other and that’s the community that we are part of. You can post somewhere and say “This is my rock. Who can I talk to” and we’ll find you somebody who can tell you all this that I went through that curious how you solve it. Here is the best solution for your sad. Need. So that’s what I don’t just you can’t just get clear on the fans it’s a matter of clarity. More than anything because. I mean you can’t poke any holes on this thing. I’ve tried and I’m very analytical and we all have by the way we all have tried to poke holes in it.Yeah that’s why we’re all here because here we are. We can’t find a hole in this thing so it’s solid I guess I better jump on it. You can’t be under the rug.Mike: Absolutely. Oh man, this has been one of my favorite interviews. It’s been a really good opportunity for me to get to know you and I so enjoyed having you today. How can people connect with you?Carlos: If somebody wants to nag if I can help with anything you know the best thing is quick text message I mean 407-​744-7190. Or they can add me on Facebook Carlos German and send me a message through there. So you know that’s how they come find me or you can put them in touch with me you know if I can be anything you know Mike I’m very happy to speak with anybody that you’re trying to get clear on their opportunity. Ultimately we’re all in this together and what I can do to help is reach out.Mike: So that was my sit down with Orlando mega producer Carlos German. I really enjoyed talking to Carlos.

Bryan explains how the EXP model fascinated him and the fururistic cloud brokrage model of EXP where everybody wins. Bryan also talks about his experience of revealing the news to his brokerage and the smooth transition which has immensely fueled his growth. He also stresses why agents should consider to join EXP and become a part of this success story.Click here to listen to the podcast. Read the complete transcript below.Mike: This is the agent revolution podcast the next evolution of the real estate industry.Let’s get started.What’s up its Mike Wall proud EXP agent, owner and team leader your host of The Agent Revolution podcast. Today I have the pleasure of talking to Mr. Lamborghini Bryan Casella about moving over his mega team to EXP. He like me was a former Keller Williams guy and saw the writing on the wall. Thank you so much for taking some time out of your day to join us today. How are you brother?Bryan: Things are great. Business is booming. Couldn’t be happier. How are you brother?Mike: I’m doing well. Man so yeah as I told you in the pre-interview. Really what we want to do today is go through the story of your transition from where you were at to where you’re at now at EXP. Talk a little bit about the story behind that. So let’s do this.I don’t like to talk a lot about your production and all that stuff but I will talk a little bit about it to set the stage for those folks listening because I think a lot of folks especially across social media platforms know you’re the dude with the Lamborghini. They know you as the dude who definitely has some success right out of the gate and I’m sure people are excited to hear your story. So, why don’t we talk just a little bit about how long you’ve been in real estate?Bryan: Cool. I just broke five years in the business now. I got a license around this time in 2013 and before I got licensed I really adopted that old school nitty gritty mentality because the only person who I really watched and got any guidance from was Mike Ferry. I think he was the only one who was really doing anything on YouTube or any videos that I could consume and say well I don’t know what the hell I’m doing but this guy says hey just go knock on doors and make calls and you can get some business. And that’s just literally what I modelled man. Luckily my office at center 21 that I started with a couple of the top agents whom Mike Ferry had trained and it was just easy for me to absorb that model and just emulated it and that’s all I did. They literally called me the robot in my first office because all I did was call knock call knock and it got results.I went through a period in the beginning where maybe for two or three months I didn’t get anything but then I got momentum after that it was deal after deal and fast forward now I have a team. One two three four agents, I have an admin and we have two teams working for us so it’s been great. We’re a little bit behind this year. I think we’re planning on closing 50 transactions roughly. We’ve bumped up our average price point a lot. I think our average price this year is around 600-620 around there and we put together some pretty exciting ones. I have one under contract now for four point eight in Laguna Beach and I’m working on another one hopefully tomorrow that will be around the same price so I’m excited to break into that ultra-luxury level.Mike: Yeah dude. That’s awesome man and it is great because I enjoy doing this because I get to connect with people like you and hear your story and I think a lot about myself because I got into the business. I’ve actually had a license since 2002 but I got into the business and just I did it from a buyer agent’s perspective for a few years. Then the market crashed and I got out, I went to corporate America and in 2013 just like you and I just started watching YouTube videos and I saw people like Colin expired and stuff like that because I didn’t have a big network here in Ohio. I’m from Texas and I met my wife at Ohio State and then we got married moved back to her hometown so I didn’t know anybody.What I did is I just started picking up the phone and in 2013 November just started making expired calls and by May of 2014, I had 44 listings. That first year I sold 57 houses. You know what I mean. Your story is no different than mine. It’s like what I tell my team “Real estate is simple but it is not easy”.Running a marathon is just put in one foot after another for 26.2 miles but it is not easy. You got to train for it and you got to show up and take action. It sounds what you did and you definitely have some experience and success and you guys have been off and running. So how long have you guys been over the EXP now?Bryan: I want to say about four monthsMike: Where were you guys before you came to EXP?Bryan: Keller WilliamsMike: We came over from Keller Williams in February too. So I can definitely identify with your story. Tell me a little bit about when you first heard about EXP. Is this something that you heard about last year or two years ago. Is it something you heard about and went hey this is what we’re doing?Bryan: Well originally for about two years, we had created the real estate hustlers mastermind. About a year ago a little bit more A.J. who sponsored me into EXP made the jump from Keller Williams. So, I heard about it a year prior to joining roughly maybe a little bit less. At first you’re a little skeptical you’re like “What is this?”. A.J. obviously we’re on the phone calls every week and he just kept sharing with us how much he was growing and all the tools and things that you get access to and what the structure of the company was and over time I started picking my interest. Then I looked I was like “It just sounds not only like a great company but a phenomenal opportunity to jump into something that’s growing and that’s new and that’s fresh”.I think that’s probably the biggest allure for me aside from all the other stuff that people talk about rev share or stock. To me that’s just like icing on the cake. Because I really want to look at. Okay this is cloud based that’s progressive. is it efficient? Our experience thus far has been great. So the more AJ shared the more I started looking that way and then I finally made the jump. Like I said around May this year.Mike: OK. AJ was a Keller William agent too. Is that what you said?Bryan: Yeah he had like 12 or 13-person team and I think Charlotte, North Carolina.Mike: OK So obviously. I do know about that Hustler’s Group too and you guys have been around and doing it for a long time and certainly obviously had a big impact on a lot of folks’ real estate careers and telling people how to grind it out I mean there’s one idea that people get repeat referral business and then there’s this other idea our umbrella that we fall under where we have just we’re just Grinder’s where we just go out make it happen. That’s not a bad thing. People run a really good business offer on referral. There are parts of me that envy that you know to me because that business just comes to us. You and I both know that it’s not really a scalable model and that grinded it out. It is more of a scalable model if you can build a skill set.Mike: You guys have been over for four months. You did your due diligence for a while. You followed A.J and let him get the bumps and bruises and then you decided as the team leader to make the move. How did you approach your broker when you decided to move to EXP? How was that conversation?Bryan: My Broker was cool. I was with Keller Williams pacific states over here in Cerritos California. That’s where we hung our licenses. It was an easy conversation. I had been kind of letting him know that I was thinking about it but there was no resistance there. There was no negativity. It was a simple and serial conversation and that has a lot to do with how I am as an individual. I’m very upfront with people so I just call them and I said Hey man if you want to meet me we can. I’m going to make this move. I’ve already made the decision. Let’s have a conversation about it. I want to let you know I wanted to leave and not say anything. It was a fairly easy conversation because I know that looms in people’s mind like well if I toss it to my broker, he’s going to try to talk you out of it. Now if your broker is really looking out for your best interests and you made the decision I think it should be an easy conversation for anybody.Mike: Yep agreed. So when you decided to make the move, what were some of the emotions that you experienced? Was there any anxiety or was there any reluctance at all to make the move?Bryan: Well, I can see the only reluctance was because it’s still kind of like a fresh company. They’re working out a lot of kinks. In the beginning we had a few issues with the cloud or agent services which now have basically evaporated and it’s super-efficient like much more than it was back then. I would say if there was any concern it would be more our perception to the public like “Oh! it is a new company”. We don’t know who it is. So maybe the customer confidence maybe a little bit lower. You can say right out the gate when they find out EXP. Never heard of it but we’ve seen as we share a little bit of information with the customers that they think it’s cool. Oh well it’s cloud based, sounds really progressive and you know new that was really my only concern because once I decided to make the job I saw the potential in the next segment I want to jump on this train right away because I support it. I think it’s an awesome idea.Mike: Yeah. You’re the first one that said that but in reality we talked to a lot of agents in our office who say that very same thing. If they talk about that brand recognition right. That’s a very valid concern. What we find in most cases like with us moving from Keller Williams over to EXP. That’s something that we definitely wanted to pay close attention to. We found our clients weren’t loyal to Keller Williams or Coldwell banker or X Y Z realty. They were loyal to us. I would imagine that if you went back and if you’ve had you’ve done 50 deals or whatever this year if you went back and talked to all 50 those people and you asked him “hey you know what brokerage I’m with?”. A lot of them would not even be able to tell you that they want you to tell you the answer. It doesn’t mean that it’s not a valid concern for some agents. I know there will be people that are listening to us talk right now that say, you know what that’s something that I was thinking about. Our people are consumers actually going to realize what EXP is. What they’re doing it in that’s all part of what we need to do as realtors is be able to educate them on who we are and what the value that we can bring as EXP.Bryan: Absolutely. As you said they hire us. They don’t hire Keller Williams or Century 21 or Berkshire Hathaway or whoever it is, they trust us. We’re the ones who puts in the work. And at the end of the day what you just asked is a concern for a lot of newer agents I noticed is well they are going to EXP but I want to go with Century 21 or Keller Williams because I feel like the public is going to perceive it better but it really doesn’t matter right. I think people put more concern on it themselves than the public, once you actually have a conversation with somebody and they see that you know what you’re doing. I don’t think it matters who could be with Bob’s Realty and they’re not going to care.Mike: So you made the switch four months ago. So you made the decision as a team leader to come over. You talk to the brokerage. You had a conversation. It sounds like that went well. That’s the way you wanted to go by the way you wanted it you want if you’re brokerage’s truly if you’ve built a good relationship with your broker. They should support you in whatever endeavors that you decide to choose. They should come from a place of abundance not scarcity.That didn’t happen with us but I’m glad it happened for you. The next thing you got to do right is you got to make the you make the decision as a team leader you then you’ve got to have the team. While a solo agent can make a decision and only have an impact on themselves and their personal business. When you as a team leader are making a decision you’re making that decision not only for yourself but everybody that works with you. That is committed to you. So I’m curious how did you arrange that meeting what did that conversation sound like?Bryan: It was very simple. You know as I said look if I’m going to sell this idea to them. Obviously I want them to support all I did was highlight other benefits. Right. So the conversation dissed them about how it’s going to benefit everybody not just me. That made it very easy. When I start talking about less fees because I have an office and I’m agents are working in here. Let’s offer it and we have to pay a better split. The cap is going to be lower. Once I got into three or four details, there was really no resistance. So once I actually wrote it out to them, it was simple I had AJ who sponsored me in is always available. So if I need to bring him in to answer any questions he can. It was a fairly easy conversation and that meeting was more than ten minutes and everyone just like were on board with whatever we wanted to do as it sounds like it’s great. Let’s do it.Mike: That’s awesome man. Like one of the things that I like most about being over here. I mean you’ve done what we’ve done in that. We have our own office space here we’ve kind of created our own culture. We have picked who we want in this building most of whom are on our team and so that was one big benefit for us. I was actually getting ready to open my own Market Center and J Kender presented the idea. This EXP cloud based brokerage to me. And I just thought it made. I thought it made more sense not for me but for my team because ultimately the only person who would have won if we opened our own market center is me. My team really would not have benefited much from that but in making the move to EXP we added in those additional layers of passive income opportunity in company provided stock right and then hitting specific benchmarks for stock and then the revenue share opportunity which was so much bigger than the profit share opportunity at Keller Williams. I think the biggest profit share check I ever got at Keller Williams was 336 dollars and I think it was June or July of last year. In my fourth month here I got a check for ten times that it was like 3300 dollars and some change. This opportunity is amazing and right where we’re just right about 15000 agents. In KW is like 170000. Just imagine the opportunity for people, the agents that are getting in right now like yourself and me and all these other guys, anyone else that’s joined. They get to present this opportunity and they get to be the people that are going to benefit 30 years from now when those revenue share checks are just coming in every month and you know whether they sell real estate or not. That was the big kind of “Aha!” for me to use a KW term. I would imagine that when you sat down specifically to talk with your guys and gals that had to be something. You felt really good about as a team leader because you couldn’t necessarily offer that Keller Williams.Bryan: Huge that was huge. Guys always ask even the agent that worked for me and other agents. What’s your plan to start selling stop selling real estate. Can you survive? I think a lot of agents don’t think about that. They stay forever it’s okay and there’s no plan. If they don’t buy real estate what are they going to do. This is something that I was even telling my team I said look whether we make the move or not you guys are going to be doing you think you’re gonna be selling. So why not be in a position where while you’re selling your building something that’s going to be completely passive. What have you said maybe in 10 or 15 years. So it literally was just like a no brainer. I tell people it’s the icing on the cake because I think people have the visions. It’s going to be like you said 20 years and just like yourself. I mean the three months are like my top Rev shares or did I like 24 or 25 hundred bucks. I’ve just gone with the company. So again that’s really sweet. But I could see that being 20 times in the next couple years and I’m like well this is exciting because now we are creating a life that are really wanted without having to be stuck to selling x amount of houses every year and being stuck on the hamster wheel forever. I think that’s the vision that a lot of people don’t look at and a lot of agents aren’t thinking about that because our industry is so to the grindstone every year. Nobody really thinks about “What do I really want to be doing this in 15 years?”. They just make the assumption that they do, then after a couple years I’m sure you’ve seen people to start burning out and then they fall off on the wayside because they have no investments or something like this which is genius.Mike: Yeah it’s great for life. I mean you talk about like recruiting and retention. Glenn just nailed it because if you got even let’s just say like you have a top producer right on your team. That’s just day. I mean that’s just crushing it right. Ultimately they decide hey you know what I’m going to go do this on my own. Right there. There’s really no benefit. There’s no reason why they would even leave EXP. They might leave your team and that’s great because that that just says I’ve done my job. I’ve created this unbelievable individual. I’ve given so much value into their life and what they feel like they can go out and do it on their own now. By keeping them in the company so if they got any revenue share at all which you know they probably have it they’re a superstar agent and then they have also agent ownership right at their best at after three years. Why the hell would they leave. They’re just probably not it. There’s no reason why they would leave so not only have you done a great thing by helping them go out on their own but then you’ve also created that revenue share for yourself and hopefully for them too. To build that and cut into that down the road.Bryan: Yeah. You just said it goes on that up in two words everybody wins.Mike: I’m curious like so now the dust probably is starting to settle right the transition is still new. I mean you’re four months in. What did this change anything? If we’re being completely candid did it change your goals? Did it affect your business at all?Bryan: It seems like there’s a new level of excitement now because they know what they can do. They have the additional thing like the revenue sharing, stocks that they didn’t have before. So I feel like there’s a little extra fire under everybody’s ass right now which is awesome because then me as a leader I train my people all the time and I get that in them. To have something else do that. I think it’s just again like the sprinkles on the cupcake. You know what I mean.Mike: Yeah. So what do you like? What is your goal with all this? You feel probably like an O.G because you feel like you’ve been doing it for a long time and you have hostile intent and that takes a lot out of you. That it is almost a natural evolution like when you’re a hustler. Hustling like that to build a team because it’s the reality of it. It’s probably not a sustainable model. It’s probably going to burn out in six years. You really want to leverage yourself with bringing in good quality people. So for you. Right. What is like what. So what’s the goal now as you’re at EXP. You have this team like Where are you taking this thing?Bryan: Well that’s a great question. There’s so much more I can do now that I’m with EXP. By virtue of me doing what I do on social media. I naturally attract agents who believe in what I say and who are attracted to my style and what I do. Therefore, I know I’m going to attract somebody who either wants to mold themselves into a great agent or probably is already a pretty damn good agent. Now I get them to the company. I am building the Rev share because I know it’s going to explode in the next couple months near for sure. I mean already have I think mid 20s and my first level and I have another like 10 or 12 process. It’s just and it’s almost 100 percent from just me doing stuff on social media. Not me going out and recruiting. I’m going out on having coffee interviews with people. It’s just literally organically because I put out the message now. So what I see happening is like I just got back from Jacksonville right throughout spoke for a company. I’m doing that a lot more. I really want to take the social media side not only to help me grow my business which by the way every single person that works for me I’ve virtually set for my girlfriend Loida I attracted from social media as well. So I just really want to keep growing the team. I know we really want to break the 1 million GCM Mark. We haven’t broken that yet. I’m really excited to do that but I think within the next 12 to 18 months I’m going to be able to fully step out from the team and let that thing kind of just keep growing the way it is and then with the social media side now especially with EXP. I can start doing other things outside of rooms. The more time I’m creating more income and it’s just making my life easier again. Doing the same thing I wanted to do anyway which to me is a no brainer.Mike: So essentially what I’m hearing you say is that you’re doubling down on your social media game because you know that is a great channel for you to provide value to the masses and get the word out about what we’re doing EXP. So. Tell me what does the game look like for you on social media?Bryan: Well it’s always been this thing where I’ve just put out right in it and it’s just shifted and evolved over time because I first started doing stuff on social media just to document my journey. I was like hey I’m a young guy, I’m getting in real estate. I have no experience. I’m probably in the same shoes as a lot of you are going to be in because I have no advantages and I don’t have any connections. I’ve never done sales. It is a first time I’m really wearing a suit to work. So I’m just going to go out there and make it happen. Over time I started not only attracting a lot of consumers and building a huge referral base which I think in July I sent out six referrals across the nation but I’m also now attracted a ton of agents and that’s led to me speaking. I’ve gone internationally and spoke in Australia earlier this year. I’ve spoken with the guys from Ireland are listing three times now. Upbeat fourth time because I’m doing something for the California transition realtors in October and also spoke at the expo. So my strategy with that is just keep putting out value attracting the right people. Raise the level of the industry because I know people who follow what I teach are going to be better agents. It’s always been with us in the beginning I’m going to give value and help people because that’s what I was missing in the beginning. I didn’t have two or three guys maybe my age bracket who are doing this sharing their journey saying man I was in tears. They lost the listing but hey here’s what I learned from it. The next nominee to handle this objection or whatever it is. Now I have almost a thousand videos for free on YouTube and probably three or four hundred that I’ve done on Facebook and I’m putting out what a lot of people are going to go through. Or what they’ve been through and they can get some perspective on it. So with me just been one-word value and I just keep putting it out and everything else is just kind of fallen into place.Mike: When did you realize the power of social media?Bryan: I saw it years ago man like when I started documenting my journey about what I was doing. It was probably about six months since early 2014. I said I think people are sleeping on this. This video thing, this YouTube thing, this Facebook thing they don’t see what I see. So I saw that vision of what I’m doing now and what could be created. I tell a lot of agents and people even outside our real estate. I say we don’t need Hollywood anymore. You can create your own brand globally and explode it with your phone. I mean our iPhone’s record 1080P high definition you can upload it straight to YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and they send it everywhere. That’s all I did until I’ve done recently some Facebook ads for real estate actual customers. All of my brand will from media growth has been 100 percent organic. I haven’t put a penny into paid ads and that I started doing some Cliff n dale stuff on the site with another guy but that’s again that’s separate not to grow my brain. So the 100,000 followers on YouTube the 5,000 friends and 12,000 followers on Facebook you know almost 30,000 followers on Instagram. That’s just me putting out value and attracting people. I saw that years ago and I think a lot of people maybe weren’t committed or they just didn’t have the vision.Mike: Right. In fact, I was watching, listening right now. It’s not too late to start. I think that you know while we have that summit. Some of us have those limiting beliefs that you know are you know he started that you know in 2013. Right. It’s like now it’s like there’s no better time to start than right now right. I mean as it relates to EXP we’re still the 15000 agent company. So the opportunity is huge. So if you want to be like Bryan man document your journey even if you feel like you don’t have that much to document. Just talk about the struggles that just be a real. Just talk about the struggles that you’re going through that’s exactly really what you did in.Bryan: Absolutely. I think that’s the missing piece for a lot of individuals who get into the social media game is to show the world who I was. It wasn’t just about real estate. I get recognized everywhere now as a realtor because I’ve branded myself that way but that’s not me. A lot of people think “oh well I can only talk about real estate”. No you don’t. At the same time because what you said is I hear that all the time was too late. Let’s say Mike just copy what I did right for all the people watching. There’s going to be a segment of the people watching who are going to like him more than me and vice versa. So there’s always an audience for everybody because I like his style more, his looks more it doesn’t matter. Anybody can come into this game and they’re going to take a portion of the market because some people will relate to them more and that’s all it is. There’s plenty of eyeballs out there for everybody. Does it to take your piece of it and it’s readily available for anybody. I don’t care how old you are. where you live and what you’re doing and especially if you’re watching this and you’re in a smaller city. It is just waiting to be took over. I know some people who are doing minimal work on social media that are in real estate in smaller cities and they’re just annihilating the market share because of just their social media presence and videos like I know people like for example with the Jacksonville Florida. There’s a girl that works for the company. Her entire business is from her free Facebook videos and her Instagram. That’s it. She generates a ton of leads gets a ton of listings from that and she hasn’t spent a penny. So for all of you who are really deathly afraid of cold calling, the door knocking there you go. But again she’s been doing it consistently for about a year and a half or two years. So you have to put in the work whether you do it virtually whether you do it on the phone. It has to be done.Mike: Right. That’s some massive value that you’re dropping brother and I appreciate that. So the goal for you is it sounds like you ultimately kind of work your way into more of a CEO type role where maybe you’re not going on so many listing or buyer appointments for that matter. You still do that some people some people do that but you want to be the visionary for the company and you want to continue to help it grow. You want to continue to help it grow you want to continue to grow your rev share group. You want to continue to spread the word about EXP. It’s funny because I asked my guy yesterday this and I’m going to start asking because I think it’s a great question. What is your rev share a goal like ultimately? Where do you want to take this thing in and hopefully you’re willing to share that number?Bryan:   Absolutely yeah. I’ve told people when I went to my first EXP event for this little mastermind they had in Vegas recently. You know if you want to I was there and I remember sitting in the audience already else telling the people around us in six months are you going to be speaking State watch. So by the end of the year, I want 100 people in my first line and I’m going for it. I think I’m pretty much on track to do that. Other people have a process but before the end of the year want to be making at least ten to twelve thousand a month and by the end of 2019 I want to see if I can crack 60.Mike:    Nice brother. That is nice. Yeah. My personal goal I’ll share is to get to twenty thousand a month by the end of the year and ultimately want to get to where I’d like. Some of these legends or make in an hour like break go and rob Fleck and these guys like to start making like a hundred grand a month I think would be a realistic opportunity.Listen we hustled right when we did expire, we hustled what we did for sale by owners. Now we’re hustling to get agents. So it’s different but it’s the same man. I’ll wrap this up man. This has been just an absolute blast for me and I mean to connect with you.Mike:    Let me ask you this man. So that agent or that broker that’s listening to us right now who may be thinking about making the move to EXP or they’re just trying to learn a little bit more about the company. What do you say to that person?Bryan:    I would say a lot of the concerns that you have in your mind are little fears that you’re creating. Because even with EXP or any other company. No company is perfect. However, I feel that EXP is taken what everyone else has done and made it better and also revolutionized their style with the whole cloud thing. That’s actually working and it’s efficient. I mean we get paid on time. Any little detail people have asked me; I give them the answer again “It’s almost like it’s too good to be true”. No opportunity is better than now. I’m kicking myself to have gotten the switch earlier. Right. But I can tell you that a lot of the fears and concerns that you have are not there.Mike: Make the jump. Now’s the time. Love it man. So How can people connect with you? If they want to engage you for a speaking event or they want to talk EXP or anything else.Bryan:    Yes, if they want to chat Facebook is the best. If you want to contact me at any other social media platform. It is just my name. @BryanCasella is my Twitter, Instagram.

        "content": "This podcast provides a comprehensive insight into Jaret Ghent’s fruitful move to EXP realty. Jaret and his wife run one of the top selling real estate teams in Sacramento. It’s interesting to know that Jaret came to know about the EXP model way back in 2010 when the executive team approached him. Jaret explains how the EXP model has evolved over the years and why everyone should be aware of it. He even mentions that EXP realty is the Amazon of the real estate industry.Click here to listen to the podcast. Read the complete transcript below.Mike: This is the agent revolution podcast. The next evolution of the real estate industry.Let’s get started.What’s up? It’s Mike Wall proud EXP agent, owner, team leader and host of The Agent Revolution podcast. Hey, I’m super excited today. Good to talk to Sacramento, California’s own Mr. Jaret Ghent. Jaret and his wife together run one of the top selling real estate teams in Sacramento. Jeret and I get to discuss in detail about when he first heard about EXP and why it took so long for him to make the switch.So let’s get started. All right!Jaret Ghent, I am so excited to be sitting down with you today. It is such an honor and a privilege to have you in house sitting down with me and certainly, we have a lot to talk about. So welcome my friend.Jaret: Glad to be here. Very excited actually to chat with you today and thanks for making this happen.Mike: You are welcome. So, Mr Ghent, how long have you been in real estate?Jaret: I have been licensed in the industry for about 21 years now actually in a few States.Mike: So you’re licensed in multiple states and you’ve been licensed for over two decades.Jaret: That’s Correct.Mike: Everyone has a story of how did they get into real state. How did you know about real estate and when did you consider real estate as a career? Tell me a little bit about it. Like how did that look?Jaret: Yeah, it’s interesting part. So I’ve always been an entrepreneur in my life from a young age. I think I had my first business when I was 12 years old. I was raised by a single mother in a small Midwest town. And we didn’t have a lot growing up. So having things materially I felt was important and most of what I accomplished was through hard work. To be candid with you in a little bit of hard knocks is probably the school I attended. I have a background in construction actually started in the construction industry under design build firm in a lot of different projects over the years. One thing led to another, buying investing in properties. The next phase or natural progression was to have a real estate license to sell our investments. And that led after a few years of having a lot of great success buying properties all over the place primarily throughout the Bay Area in Northern California. It led me to get a real estate license, dive into that and quickly learn that the real estate industry was an animal all in itself.Mike: Yeah. No absolutely I couldn’t agree more. And so that’s one thing that stands out for me. I think you’re my eighth guest and obviously everybody’s story is a little different but I think the one thing that I hear a lot of times is while talking to most of these team leaders and yourself is that everybody has this entrepreneurial mindset. In other words, they got in to some other type of business potentially first or they had always intended it to be in business for themselves. So that kind of stands out with you as well. So you came into it a little bit different then than some of our other guests. You were an investor first and then you thought why don’t I sell my own properties and add another 3 percent to the kitty.Is that correct?Jaret: Yeah that’s exactly and the other part of that is that I’ve always had a passion about homes and building, I think really what it was but candidly I’m a union trained journeyman carpenter. I mean I’ve built houses and designed them from the ground up. So that experience just led me to the other phase which was the real estate phase in the late 90s where like I said I’d out there having a real state license was a simple access saving in commissions which I quickly learned the real estate business was not when I bought it was in it’s a tough road. It takes a lot of training experience. And I love the challenge and I had had a few construction industries or what really led me and pushed me more to the sailed into that was two things. One was I absolutely was intrigued at the business and the challenge of being the best which has been my personality my whole life. I mean that’s really what my focus was at that time was to take something that at first I didn’t have a lot of skills that in reality as far as the licensing end of it. And become the best region has just been my personality my whole life. And I took it and ran. I was blessed with a couple of mentors. One that actually worked with us for a year at Remax and that kind of got my Remax career started and off to a little bit of a start but without that mentor, I don’t believe that it would have been as successful as it was.Mike: How did you go from just having this mindset where you know what I’m going to get in because I can sell my own properties and I can save 3% of the commission or whatever that looks like for me to Man! you know there’s a real opportunity here I think you know I can make more of this.I think I can I be the number one agent or one of the most productive agents in my market. How did you make that switch?Jaret: You know it’s interesting about that you that’s it. That’s a great question. So, really what happened was I had gone back to the challenge of being successful in real estate. You know I think a lot of people that jump in our business believe that it’s easy idea, I did. I think that signs in front of properties and this job. And I just quickly learned that “That’s not a fact”. In fact, what I learned was the business was difficult and that it took a skill set. I just delved into to it. I mean I still continue to buy properties without a question but I really delved into the sales side of it. I spent a majority of my early career with ReMax probably over about seven or eight year period where I was with two franchises; one franchise ironically recruited me from the other. Yeah I just I delved in to. Learning from people around me being around great people. A lot of hard work, a lot of mistakes and eventually the hard work and really out of the box. I don’t do things the way most people do things in the business. I never have and probably anything I may be good. That may be best served me well it’s hurt me at other times but in complete transparency it helped me become top 10 percent the world for five years with Remax back in early 2000s. So it was an incredible accomplishment. We got a team. I had a few Buyers agents. Couple of primary agents my wife was helping me at that time run the business on the back end of the hard work and we had a lot of great success.Mike: That’s great man.Mike: So your best year in real estate. What did that look like for you from a production standpoint?Jaret: I spent the last few years that I was in real estate as I recall I was probably still back in the day I think back in the day when you say that Remax’s model was there you couldn’t count production of other agents or team agents. That is based on your own production and I want to say that it was around 25 or 30 million dollars a year. That was my own personal sales production. I had some pleasure in investments that were outside of that as well that I was doing. But it was a significant amount of real estate for a few years as you can imagine. But, it was it was a great ride I’ll tell you that.Mike: I actually started in the business also with ReMax and my mentor here in in southwest Ohio was a guy named Phil Herman. Do you know him?Jaret: You know its interesting. I mean I’ve probably been out of the business so long and I am not sure if I will get any more names. Probably if he had been around for a while because I was a part of the international market, and part of the awards ceremony that were going on with ReMax. To be candid with you, I believed it was the only place to work at that time. I feel really bad it was and I probably might have known him.Mike: Sure. So you’re focused heavily on supporting other agents and coaching and training and you’re also supporting your wife as well in her business. What is how is that currently structured?Jaret: Yeah. If you don’t mind I would like to share a little back history that will help understand where I’m currently at. So after spending many years and trying to solve the puzzle of a better way to do business, to be more efficient, earn more, it just gets to a point when you’re paying a brokerage. I don’t know last year I paid sixty thousand dollars or something. We were on our own. So, my wife and I created our own independent brokerage for a decade. Great independent company. I walked from the Northern California market as I had it and was going to get out and build a brokerage. I kind of got on the technology end of the business and I knew there was change coming early, actually some say way early. I created a company called Vision Real state. It was an independent brokerage. We ran during the downturn and we had a lot of great success. It was really virtual paperless forward thinking model similar to where we’re at now with EXP. It was kind of an interesting 10 year period. We had a lot of great agents, a lot of great success, some failures along the way but just constantly knowing that there was a change in our industry coming, it was around the corner and how I first heard about EXP and ended up here ironically was in 2010. I had been contacted by the executive team. At that time, I think Jason just started with EXP being a state broker way back then and my ego said no. I think I gave a little bit and thought what we had was a pretty good model in business. I just have always been entrenched with keeping an eye on where EXP has gone and watching them grow. Frankly.Mike: Isn’t that interesting. I mean so EXP has been around since 2009 and you heard about it in 2010 in Boise Idaho. Now when you say Jason, are you talking specifically about Jason Gaffing?Jaret: YesMike: What you got, that’s amazing and you got to come in a little bit there. How was the entire dynamics as you were approached by the leadership team and you created your own company and you were being pursued by a new company. That’s a crazy story, dig into that for me.Jaret: Yeah it is crazy. When you’re independent, you have little bit of success. I think people find you. Our web presence was pretty dynamic at that point and the company being in real estate. We use the cloud based terms and we had some modeling similar to what is offered at EXP. It was pretty simple to probably do a little research and see that we had a parallel vision and it was interesting. I think Jason hadn’t been with the company very long. It was back in the day when they were hiring state brokers in every state looking to grow in different markets versus having the license as they do now and obviously adapting evolving as things go along with it. It was a trip. I don’t look back at that with any regrets I looked at it really did the timing wasn’t right in the first phase. A few of them were pretty intriguing. Honestly I still have to say that like a lot of people I talked to including myself just not long ago my ego and what I built was in the way period.Mike: Yeah. One of the questions I ask everybody is to talk about your reaction when you first heard about EXP and you went into that organically which is great. What’s really behind that question is I want everybody to know my story is similar in that I heard about EXP from a person who really didn’t have the influence and maybe my ego was in the way. But it just it for whatever reason it didn’t resonate with me until I heard it from somebody that I really looked up to and who influenced me. You may have a similar story or it may just be that timing, the timing wasn’t right. What I want people to hear when I talk through that with you is the fact that it’s not always that EXP is not the right company for you or whatever company is not the right company for you. It’s just maybe that the timing isn’t right and that’s okay. I would encourage anybody especially those few who are who are trying to stay educated and abreast of what’s changing in technology and in the real estate market to always at least get the information in order to make an intelligent decision.So you heard about EXP in 2010. When did you actually come over to EXP? When did you make the move?Jaret: I moved to support my wife’s business here in the last few years. It really have passion about coaching and helping agents. The main scenario that got us initially looking was a guy I also worked with at Remax right here in the Sacramento region. I worked with Brent at Remax when he made the move. It was probably more than 19 months ago and it made a noise in our market. So obviously it drew our attention because he was somebody that I highly respected. I had known for some time. To talk about timing, that really drew our eyes towards him but I never really looked at it.EXP has gone through a lot of change in the last few years by adapting and evolving which is what you should do. It’s a whole different company now. So the interesting dynamic there was it had our eyeballs on the prize. We were looking at an opportunity to plug into a company where we could scale and grow, where we could work again in multiple markets meaning outside of California and as a bit of an exit strategy from this business. So it kind of got us really looking in to the model. Now everybody asked me this market “hey so you’re working with Brent”. Actually my partner is Jay Kender. When I heard that he pulled the trigger. That was the person that influenced me to stop and say what am I missing. I’m missing something. Not that I didn’t respect everything that Brent had done. I have my eye on it. My wife and I had but again it came back to the timing and it came back to somebody that I’ve known for a while that I respect highly. Then all of a sudden now that he’s making this move, I knew that there was probably something that was missing. I just had to take a little closer look. When my wife and I did. Honestly we said why didn’t we do this two years ago.Mike: Yeah man what a great story. That is so true I think for so many different people and in so that. What I really want to resonate here is the fact that I think in reality a lot of it is also Influence. And for me you know I was involved in a way with Jay, Mike, and Allen those guys. And so when I first got into the business or back into the business in 2014 I was coaching with them. So they obviously had a huge influence on me so when I see these guys that who I look up to and respect start to pull the trigger and make a move. And these guys I mean they are uber successful. They own their own brokerages and they’re all making the move.It certainly is a disrupter and it certainly makes you re-evaluate where you are. So I mean I get it. And what I want you know that agent and brokers that’s listening to you and I talk here to resonate with them. You’re going to be approached or you could be approached in your market by different people and for whatever reason you, either that person doesn’t have any influence or the timing is not right for you. I would just encourage you to get as much information as you can. Over a hundred agents every week are joining this company and why that the company’s doubled in size over the last six to eight months. That’s a big deal. And you know, I don’t want to you don’t want to talk this to death. Obviously this is more about you today but I’m glad you put that out there because I think that will impact that agent or that broker who is listening, who shares a similar experience with you.Jaret: I want to kind of give a different perspective here because I hear a lot of different things not every market is a bit different. I have met people who think ultimately timing is everything. If it is then I believe that the timing is now. The company has made very intelligent business decisions. They have influenced influencers. When you see top people who are not only smart but they’re looking for a better way and they know the industry in and out. There making these moves on a daily basis. I can tell you the timing is now, the company is going to continue to grow and continue to flourish but there’s just things that they have done at a level in the last couple of years most people don’t really understand because they don’t take the time to look.The second part is people. People run companies. The people and the quality people that are around every day from whom you and I benefit from. Probably the biggest thing that I didn’t even realize when I joined the company was not even a factor. I would have the advantage to work with some of the brightest minds in real state. I would build a network with them and seek training from them and merger with them and mass remind them. That never even entered into equation of thoughts as there were other things that we were looking at dynamically. And I think that now is really why the growth is at a Big Pace is that it’s our business. There is finally a huge influence that moves everybody. That people get it and then there’s another perspective about business models that people don’t think about. There’s a lot of different talk with things going on between our company other companies good bad or indifferent. But the behind the scenes I’d run a brokerage in I had a plan to have a national company and a national network and a grand plan. What you quickly realized. And what position EXP has put themselves in that nobody thinks about. Is that this company has licenses the majority of the state now in the country and obviously outside the states of the U.S. What they have is they have data. They have access now to MLS systems under one roof. They have access to data which could be critical and pivotal if it’s used appropriately, what I mean is that they can do or will do in the future with that which is a huge benefit for anybody at this company. And that’s a little deep I don’t want to be a little deep. But that’s not that I think that’s often way over looked in this company.Mike: Yes, I get it man. That is the push with Keller Williams becoming a technology company. I mean a lot of people are making push for data right now and we know you know. We know who ever at the end of the day whoever owns the data. They’re going to control where the market goes in the future or at least have some leverage with that data. So I’m going to go back to you talking about when you made the change this year by talking to your wife.Was that a struggle for you guys? I mean with your current situation you talked a little bit about ego. I know that’s been an issue for Mark and me personally. Was that a struggle? when you guys decided what would happen. I mean when you guys just decided okay, there’s enough information. It’s time to make the change. What did that conversation look like with your wife?Jaret: Yeah it was interesting and obviously my wife and I have not only been married 25 years this October and the we have been together nearly 30 years. We’ve been working together for some time. At one point she supported me and at another point I was supporting her. When we first evaluated it. The ego side of me said I wanted to keep what I created Vision real estate in that brand and in that model. And yet we could do this brokered by whatever even with EXP and keep tracking along because that was important to me. My wife, the factor was she was the broker at the time she’s out there selling every time she’s a responsible broker. So really that liability mitigating risk that comes along with that that was a huge factor for her and the opportunity for us to build an exit strategy to invest in the company that we believe in the future to purchase the stock, earn stocks and build team across borders. We wanted to rebuild back in Idaho. That’s actually what we’re doing. We have a team in Idaho and our team here in Northern California personally. So those are all factors that weighed into you. The crazy thing is what I showed you man crazy is. As much as that was in my way. I just spent. The last couple of weeks. Rebranding all of our marketing our websites and absorbing. We are EXP. The colors, the logos, we got rid of our namesake and everything because we’re in it. We as much as out with a hurdle for me probably more than my wife. We’re EXP and that’s where we’re at and we’re proud where we were work and we like the environment that we work in and the direction this company is going. There have been bumps in the road companies that have this kind of growth. Nothing is perfect but our transition was smooth. In fact that was probably one of our biggest innovations is winding down and brokerage after decades. What does outlook why and then what will the transition be over. it was really pretty seamless and in here. It was really a pretty smooth. Transition. Better than what we had anticipated. There’s no doubt that we get it. We’ve run a company before. Nothing’s perfect although we want perfect things happen automatically. Just be perfectly just because you think they should be. The big man scheme we believe we are in the right place at the right time. We believe we’re the Amazon of real estate. We believe we are the future of the Industry. Could I believe that for years I say in 2000, I wrote a blog. Here’s a crazy story. I wrote a blog in 2000-2001 that said the internet will forever change the real estate industry. If I could share with you and even give you some picture of the backlash that I got from that, from as deeply as the ones that told me I was crazy. Some said I was a kook. They said it will never happen. Now you look fast forward and It’s exactly what has happened. Technology, our industry, the internet, all of it ran together is shaping the way we do business. Everybody everywhere. In every industry is changing. And I just believe. Glenn understood that and it. Had a plan. And the people around him to put it in order different part Angele brave enough to venture out into kind of uncharted territory right.Mike: Yeah absolutely. So that agent or broker listening to you and I talk right now and you know and they’re thinking about making the move to EXP. What would you say directly to them?Jaret: Well I’ll tell you candidly there. If you think you’ve heard about EXP he may be heard about a year ago. Or frankly still arguable that haven’t. Take the time to actually evaluate the business model. In actual people they say look if you’re an agent or a broker.You know we we’ve done all those roles. In the broker level the keyword in broker is broke. I mean you have a successful business. We ran a successful business and were very profitable at what we did because we ran it more as a team model and we had our structures set. However. We’d also understood that we were in the business. And then once we exited the business the business didn’t exist. So this is really in my opinion. A no brainer from a real estate brokers small independence that I truly believe that. We just wish we had started a little bit earlier as we missed about a little bit. On their respective. The facts are simple that people don’t quite realize that the. Agents believe they need a lot of things that don’t even actually exist even in a traditional model. At the end of the day what an agent needs to look at EXP. They look at EXP for Not only the future and their future but the opportunity of collaboration. To be with people like yourself that are top professionals they have a financial state in their success. That’s not a bad thing. I mean it’s a great thing to have people that loved to help love to coach and have taken all the knowledge, incredible experience like yourself, have sold some homes, that will take their time to teach you. How to have success. Because it makes sense.People need to sit down like we did over eight years. They need to sit down and look and listen and see what am I missing. I’m telling you. There’s really a lot of people there are going to look back. When I started here there were 5000 agents. There’s to be a lot of people who are going to look back one day they’re going to look back at his company and go “Man I wish I would have gotten involved”. Back in 2017 or 2018. When the company has 100000 agents. Strong. Across the country or across the world or more because this is the future of this business model. The way you do business. Today! This model is it and I believe it.Mike: Boom. I love it man, I love it. The hashtag for the show is - the keyword in broker is broke. The keyword in brokers are broke. So hashtag keyword a broker is broke. I love that man. Thank you so much for spending some time with me today. Like I said it’s just been it’s been an honor to sit down and chat with you and I appreciate you sharing your experience.Jaret: I appreciate it. I appreciate you too. Anything I can do in a future, we’ll chat down the road I’m sure. Keep killing it. Thanks for having me on today. Hopefully we’ve had a little bit of insight to some people that are reaching out there wondering or I’m sure they need to reach out to you and really take a deep dive and learn a little bit more about the ins and outs and all the good here at EXP.Mike: Yeah I mean I appreciate it. So one more question knowledge to go so that you know you have a great story and I know this will resonate with some people. How can people connect with you?Jaret: The easier way honestly is simply Facebook. I mean unfortunately I haven’t moved. I’ve got an Instagram account, but not quite active. Maybe it’s my age. Facebook, it’s just my personal name. So, connect with me there and my web address is jaretghent.com. I have been there for years. So, yeah anyone that wants reach out to ask questions I would be happy to answer them.Mike: All right Jarret. Hey thank you so much. I just loved talking to Jaret and hearing about his journey.

        "content": "This Podcast highlights the problems faced by independent brokerages and team leaders across the States. The challenge of not having a suitable work culture and dealing with problems within the team. Kyle Whissle, #1 agent in San Diego, California who switched over to EXP talks about his personal struggles and his thoughts on the amazing EXP model. Kyle also talks about how he started adoping technology and the associated benefits.Click here to listen to the podcast. Read the complete transcript below.Mike: Welcome back to another episode of The Agent revolution podcast. Every week we sit down with the top agents across the country who have seen this amazing opportunity to grow with EXP.I’m your host EXP mega agent and team leader Mike Wall.We’ve got a big time producer super excited to be sitting down with the number one agent in San Diego California “Mr. Kyle Whissel”.Kyle was a personal friend of mine. We’ll talk to him about his journey to EXP. You’ll definitely want to hear what this guy has to say.All right. First of all, I just want to say thank you so much for giving us some of your time today. I know your time is very precious and I want to also say something because you’ve always been kind of a mentor from afar.Having you on today is not only an honor for our audience but it’s truly special to me because like you know you’ve done so much for the industry and this is not just from the EXP standpoint but from a real estate standpoint. And so it is truly an honor to have you on the call today.Mike: So why don’t we start off with you know a little backstory and tell everybody how you know you ended up getting into real estate? How did this all take place?Kyle: Yeah for sure. I grew up in a real estate family my dad was a commercial realtor.Basically before I was born and started company back in 1979 I was born in 1981. I personally hated real estate growing up because my dad was he was a top producing realtor himself and he was always out there crushing it. But a lot of times he was not showing up. My parents were divorced at a young age and other times not showing up to you know the soccer game or the basketball game or was missing on days he was supposed to be with me or he was late and all that stuff and so as a kid growing up I hated real estate because I associated those times where my dad was late or a no show.So never in a million years growing up did I think I would get into real estate. But when I was 19. I think I was scooping popcorn at a movie theater at the time and my dad kept pushing me to buy something just not early 2000. He’s like Son you’ve got to buy some you got to buy something like the market’s hot. I was like scooping popcorn at a movie that I can’t buy anything and he’s like you can do it you’ve got good credit. So they put a mirror under my nose I fogged it. They gave me a loan for five hundred thousand bucks. That’s just how it used to work. Back in the early 2000s as part of the reason why the market crashed but so I got in. I bought that property held it for three months then I sold it. I made seventeen thousand bucks while I was at a movie theater scooping popcorn and they had recently offered me a nickel raise. So I talk to my dad and I was like hey. All right I know I hated real estate my whole life. But it’s time we talk about this real estate thing because I just made seventeen thousand bucks when I’m 19 years old in college. That was pretty awesome. So I started out in the industry in the Commercial.Mike: You were hooked.Kyle: Yeah I mean 17 grand was a lot of money. So yeah I started out with my dad. He did a lot of commercial stuff mostly apartment buildings and some shopping centers. So we worked together we teamed up on all of that stuff and I learned a ton from him as far as the negotiation and all of that stuff goes and just the industry in general.There was a big disconnect when it came to technology. I mean he was he found a property he liked to send to his client. He would print, tape a post-it note, put it over the other agent’s name and stamp his name on the post-it notes and then fax to a client, it was insane. I mean this was in 2000’s like this wasn’t in 1960. He was doing that and it was just such a disconnect with technology. I was getting a little frustrated with it. We were selling a lot of apartment buildings to the guys who bought them and converted them into condos and sold them up individually.At the same time the city made it impossible to do those condo conversions anymore.My frustration with the technology kind of had a boiling point and so I decided to branch out from my dad start my own thing and a lot of my investors that were buying these apartment buildings when they couldn’t convert them to condos anymore.They were like well it doesn’t make sense to buy these apartments because the numbers don’t make sense.what about that foreclosure over there? What about that short sale over there?When I started looking around and I saw these agents you know with hundred short sales &amp; 200 foreclosures like it was insane to me. And I was in my early 20s and I was like you know these commercial checks have been really cool. They are big checks but in your early 20s when you only get a check every two or three months and it’s a big check trying to make that last is not an easy thing to do. Seeing these people on the residential side they were really closing a deal a day.So I transition over to the residential side and started up in like 2008. So it’s about 10 years in the residential area now. I am closing more than a house today which is really awesome!Mike: That’s just freaking awesome and I think you know for us so one of the things that I’ve always really admired about what you guys do is the kind of culture that you’ve created and I think you know I think when you talk to team leaders about recruiting and retention a culture is a big part of that. And so I can only imagine that you know OK so you transition from commercial into residential and then you know automatically like are you.Kyle: So are you on your own at this point or are you already starting and you already kind of started to go down this whole team structure Pat so when I initially branched out on my own I hired an assistant day one.I’ve literally never worked without an assistant.I don’t understand why anybody would work without an assistant because the same that’s always stuck with me from a young age as if you don’t have an assistant you are the assistant. So you know you need an assistant no matter what you’re doing you need to have somebody because if you look at the work you’re doing you know in a perfect world you’re making 50-100 bucks an hour minimum and you can hire people to help you for 10-15 bucks an hour depending on the part of the country.So you should be focusing on all activities and you can hire somebody to do the 15 dollar activities. You’re actually making an extra 85 bucks an hour by hiring an assistant. So people focus too much on the fifteen dollars an hour they got to pay the assistant. Not the 85 dollars that it’s going to make them. Always got to have an assistant. So I started out with an assistant from day one ran with that for a while.I started landing a lot of these foreclosure account, started getting a lot of short sales and I was getting all these leads coming in. I didn’t really know what to do with them I really had no idea what the valuable lead was back then. So I initially had a buddy who ran a big box brokerage and I would like a once a week them some leads if they could convert them.It was crazy. Once a week I’d export leads and send them to them. Of course that didn’t work they never converted anything. I tried to have a couple agents work under my brokerage but with no supervision like hey here’s the lead. Maybe you guys can convert them. and now it’s just going to people right now. But I didn’t train on my management systems and they didn’t convert anything. I was like I’m. I got to do something here, this is not working I’m wasting all these leads.So one-day Dell had a sale on computers for like two hundred fifty bucks. I thought it was time to do something big and I bought 10 computers. I only had two people working with 10 computers. Like let’s just go all in. It’s time to do this. I bought 10 computers and then I was like shit I got 10 computers like I need some office space now. So then I went I found an office and I was I cool I got space I got 10 computers now and people. And then the first year I hired anybody with a poll sat me and I had people that were 8 years old all the way up to 80 years old. And that was a huge mistake. I lost well over six figures that first year because I had people that were inventing apps and I had people that didn’t even know what an app was. It was crazy like it was just a terrible idea.The first year was a very expensive learning lesson I started to understand the value of culture and started hiring the right people to fit within our culture of which we are young we are tech savvy. Were like were aggressive. We really started to identify what our culture is and we’d like to have fun while we have a work hard play harder mentality and once we really nailed down that culture. After hiring the right people to fit that culture our transactions went from 82 transactions to 242 transactions.It was a huge leap.Mike: That’s impressive man!  Ok. So what is the catch?Kyle: We’ve been it’s been growing sense dot at that point we we’re still doing a lot of Oreo and a lot of short sales stuff.We had a high unit count but our average price point was bad. I mean we’re insanı of Californians 70 miles of coastline here beaches andOur average price point was like 267.  We started to see the show happen to market and got away from all the foreclosures stop and started shifting to traditional and the cool thing is we’ve been able to keep our transaction count up but we’ve tripled our average price point since then. So you know last year we finished at over 250,000,000 dollars’ volume which has been amazing.Mike: That’s sick man! I’m sitting here in the Midwest; we would love an average sale price up to 60. So we’re having to make our money through units. The scenarios are totally different and the cost of living is also less. I’m a little jealous that you know your average price point is so much higher than ours. It’s a blessing and a curse because you know here you can do a deal a month and make six figures.So getting agents to push beyond just making six figures is tight. Mike: Yeah I can only imagine So I’m curious you know that the whole the whole reason behind why I decided to do this podcast is because I wanted to talk about it and it’s entitled age revolution.I wanted to talk about like you know I wanted to provide a platform for agents to come in and talk about change and specifically related to the psychology of what they went through when they moved from wherever they were at to EXP because let’s face it everybody has a different story to tell. So my first interview was with a guy named Al Stesek and last week interviewed a guy named Jay Kender who comes from similar background. They both had their own brokerage’s and yet they each had a different story to tell. And so you know that that’s kind of setting you up for you know so when you when you transitioned over right.You built this unbelievable company with a great culture and it’s like you had everything I mean at that point some realtors would look at you and say that you are absolutely crazy for upsetting the apple cart here you’ve just got so much going on for you. So I mean you that why don’t we let’s talk about when you first heard about the EXP, what were your thoughts? Did you pass the idea over like I did and several other agents or did you get it right away?Kyle: I had heard the name but didn’t really know what it was. Initially started hearing the name a little bit more and more but it wasn’t until I started seeing names make them move that I recognized that I really took the time to dive deep into it.So I think from the first time I heard about it to the first time I actually dove into it. It was probably six months then once I dove into it I was committed within two weeks.Mike: Wow!Kyle: Once you really dive out the model you realize the opportunity and a big part of that opportunity is being early to the party, this isn’t a cocktail party or you want to show up fashionably late. This is where you want to be the first person to the party get the best seat in the House and really take advantage of that opportunity. So Daniel Beren we get kind of looking at this thing and we went to lunch and it was like things are about to shake up a little, things are changing in our industry and I was like I got a feeling you’re looking at the same thing I am.We realize that we had both been looking at the same model and decided like you’re in and let’s do this thing together. Let’s go full steam ahead and then we met with Mary Maloney who’s another really heavy hitter here in San Diego and she was looking at the same thing and she linked arms with us and now we’ve got hundred to a million dollar producers all over the country that have linked arms with us.Mike: That’s amazing man. How is your team structured? How many agents did you have? What did your admin staff look or the size of your team when you decided to move over to EXP?Kyle: We all leaned. We had about 20 agents and we have about let’s just call it 30 people total between agents and support staff assistants all of that stuff. We are running at about 30 people total. When we made the move we had one agent go a different direction everybody else stayed on board with us.So we had a really good transition over to where we were able to retain almost everybody I think everybody really saw that vision.Mike: That’s awesome man. We were kind of the same way on maybe just a smaller scale because I think when we when we broke from Keller Williams We had 15 agents in one stay. So I can relate. I’m curious though when you decided when you decided as the business owner that you were moving to EXP what was the conversation with your team like?Kyle: I made a big change with our trip about a year ago and I learned a really valuable lesson is there is a right way and a wrong way to you know convey a big change like this.The change can be too big and scary. Keeping bottled up will only lead to problems in the future. Breaking the news suddenly is not the best way to break it. So I did the same thing a year ago and lost a lot of people in the process. I learned from that lesson is you don’t when you have a big change like that you really need to uphold your core people aside the people that have been with you a long time. The ones that are really the icons in your company the ones that people look up to that people follow that people emulate.Hold those guys aside first and sit down and have a conversation with them about what you’re looking to do and make sure that they’re on board get there by and with it first. It accomplishes a couple of things.It makes sure they know they’re special that they’re not just an agent with your team they’re your inner circle and you really value their opinion and into by getting their buy in upfront when you can roll it out to the remainder of your team or your brokerage. Then that inner circle who everybody looks up to is already on board and is going to have your back. So the objections come up. They’re actually helping to handle those objections for you.They’re showing that they’re excited that they’re all in on it. I think that’s really important. Any time you make a big change with a team or a broker it does have that inner circle meeting first. It makes the others more comfortable during the change.Mike: Yeah, that’s an interesting concept and I’m glad I think that will help a lot of people especially people that are managing bigger teams. So essentially what you did is you’ve got buying it from the top down. Let’s face it we know that as team leaders that that our team members are going to share different information with the team better than they might normally with us. So if you can get the buy-in from those icon agents on your team and you can join forces. Once the agents that are maybe low on the totem pole or a new or maybe don’t have that guide then if you get the buy in from your top agents then they can help you bring these other agents with a different conversation along the way. So I mean that’s just I think that’s a piece of advice for maybe those people who run large teams or even small teams for that matter because you know even if you run a smaller team you probably got one agent that does the bulk of the deals. So getting buy in from that upper level is critical.Kyle: Yeah absolutely makes them massive difference when you roll out again, making them feel special and having them support you on the roll out.Mike: Yeah, it’s funny because when I was when I was getting ready to transition over I actually was considering opening up a Kellerman’s Market Center. And we had a core group, we were supposed to launch it this month actually if I would have stayed at Keller Williams. We’d have been watching the markets this month and then this opportunity came through Kender. I spoke with him and saw a video that he had sent out but you know it was a little scary for me because I committed to opening this market center and then I heard about this idea. So you can imagine that it was kind of like shit or get off the pot. We decided to go the EXP route but the reason why we decided to do it is because you know the market center would have been something that would have been good for me. It would have been profitable for me but it wouldn’t necessarily have done anything for everyone on my team and so when I looked at the opportunity for EXP and I saw the opportunity for stock awards I saw the opportunity for revenue share and I just thought it made more sense for me long term for sustainability purposes to go to EXP because you know a big issue for us was always recruiting and retention. If I could provide this opportunity through revenue sharing and stock awards then you know your best people you know would essentially never leave. And so I’m curious what was when you decided we’re all in on the EXP.Mike: What were some of the main components for you that made EXP a better opportunity for you and your team?Kyle: Yeah, just to make sure if people aren’t familiar with me I ran my own brokerage. I was an independent brokerage from day one. I’ve never worked for a franchise my entire career.I’ve never even really been entertained by a franchise like it’s just never been something that I’ve been into and I got approached 12 months prior to making the move over to EXP I got approached by multiple big brands. We’re looking at purchasing and selling of an independent broker just one of those things that everybody thinks is like the big “sexy payoff” at the end of the whole thing when you build an independent brokerage that you’re going to build this thing and then sell it for millions and millions of dollars.It’s really not all that it seems you know what ends up happening is when they value your company they’re going to look at your net income which is the technical term eBid, which is basically the net income of your company. Then they’re going to take your production out of the equation. So a lot of the big brokerages out there where you have a leader who is still producing. Once you take that team leader’s production or the broker’s production out of the equation there’s really no money left. Usually all the agents cover the expenses and then the brokers production is the profit. Well once you take that broker out there’s a lot of times no profit left over. So the brokerage is actually worthless. But let’s just assume for some crazy reason that you net in a million bucks without producing this crazy anomaly. So that’s based on your eBid that they’re going to work off. Then they’re going to pay you somewhere between 3 and five times on that number. So let’s shoot in the middle and call it 4X.So they’re going to buy you for 4 million dollars. Sounds amazing? Give me a check for four million I’m out. It doesn’t work that way. You’ll get a small portion of it up front and then you’ll get the remainder over a multi-year period. Let’s just call three years that you’ve got to stay with the company and then get what’s called an earn out so you earned the other three million out of the deal. Well to get that additional money let’s call it a million a year. You’ve got to hit certain benchmarks with the number of agents that stay with the company the production of those agents you’ve got to hit all these different milestones which are so difficult to get because when you get bought by one of these big franchises now there’s going to be this new franchise fee that your agents weren’t paying before when you were independent. So now you got 6 or 7 percent coming off the top. Good luck retaining all your agents with that.Now you’re on a honest split like a 90 percent split. Well I did a million GCI personally last year. There goes a hundred thousand bucks a year. You know that I’m paying just in my own splits like all his money starts disappearing.You miss all those earn out marks on his identity the day after three years is done you’re lucky if you got half of that for a million bucks. And again like you mentioned maybe I get that two million dollars after that four years is done. Your team gets nothing. They got stuck with a new franchise fee they didn’t have earlier. I didn’t see that as a win. So I wanted to look for something else that you know is not only going to benefit me but it’s going to benefit my team as well. Something that truly is going to provide for everybody. When I saw the ability to build up you know something similar to a retirement plan with the stock that the EXP provides and then I saw the ability to build up some passive income with the revenue share opportunities they provide. The fact that those are things that not only go to me but everybody on my team like. That was huge for me and that was a big game changer for us coming in.I also looked at the fact that I’m not liable anymore and one of my new favorite sayings are not my problem because I’m not the broker. There is a broker of record now and you know a situation gets sticky. I’m not the one who’s got to deal with it. There’s a broker it’s that deal with that. That’s what he’s paid to do. So to let go of a lot of those headaches and liabilities huge I was able to cut down my insurance costs by five figures. So all that stuff was really big for us. Coming over but what’s been like. That’s what led us to all the stock, the revenue share, the liability cutting expenses. So what I’ve come to actually appreciate the most now that we’re in is the company of the people around us you know being able to connect with you being able to connect with guys like Mike Reese and Jay Kender and Al Steek and you know Brett Jennings up in Northern California Mark on the Troy Olina pan now you know North Carolina like to have access to all these people that are pouring into each other and helping like the community of this company is just on another level and a big part of that is because we all own stock in the same company. All we want to see this company succeed. The willingness of everybody in the company to help each other has just been phenomenon and the relationships and stuff that have been created in the first few months here is just something that wasn’t even on my radar when we made this move. But it’s actually become one of my favorite parts of the whole thing.Mike: That’s awesome man. That is that is awesome. So now where you’re at today? When did you guys join?Kyle: March.Mike: Same time we did I think we came on in February. So now I guess you could say the dust is settled or at least settling now. Is there anything different from the previous framework?Kyle: Yeah I say you know just for us having never been with a franchise just kind of learning how to work within somebody else’s framework you know there’s a little bit of an adjustment for that.I think we’ve got all that stuff nailed down now. We told our team like hey there is going to be a learning curve on this. It is totally new to you just like it is new to us. So work with us on this and we’ll get everything squared away. And I think we really got stuff nailed down now. I know our TC’s are loving using Sky slope as our transaction management system we want wanted sky slope when we are independent but it was too expensive. And so we had to have an inferior product. So now to have Sky slopes been really awesome the two Cesur 11 that a lot of the agents you know are starting to see some stocks show up in there and they’re starting to see some revenue share checks show up. So that stuff is all those been really cool. I think you know it’s it’s all come together. Then there’s just so much value being added by all the different people that were in alignment with that part is just been amazing.Mike: Well I’ve got a couple more questions for you. I’m wondering now that you’ve made the change you guys are you know fully embedded into the EXP community. So let let’s pull back a little, so what is your why like what drives you everyday to do all this?Kyle: Both my parents have been through multiple cancers. My mom passed away in 2009 and it got to the point where she was laying in her deathbed and not that my mom didn’t live life to the fullest or anything. It was a very visual thing to actually see somebody laying in their deathbed and to think about the thoughts that are going to go through my head when my time comes and I’m laying in that bed, the last thing I want is to be in that bed and have any regrets and you know wish I would have tried a little bit harder. Wish I would’ve taken a chance, pushed more wish or would have done this or that. I just don’t want to have any of that.I’ve made a commitment to myself that I’m never going to go to sleep and when my head hits the pillow if I know I left anything on the table that day I wouldn’t be able to sleep. Day in day out and give 100 percent on everything, it’s become an obsession for me like that’s all I know how to do like I struggle sometimes because you know I’ll have agents on my team set these goals and then they don’t even start on them like I’m going to knock hundred doors this week and then you check in and it’s zero. I can’t even comprehend that my brain is not wired in that way. I don’t even understand. If I said I’m going to knock on doors. I’m probably going to end up knocking 200. That’s just all I know because I’m always going to go all out with every single thing that I do.Mike: Yeah that’s awesome!  You know the perspective you have on life is amazing because it’s truly the fire that burns inside you that when you wake up every day you know you’re on a mission.It’s like we start everyday unemployed and that’s kind of the way I look at everything. And sometimes for my agents I want it worse than they do. It is very hard for me to comprehend that, so I certainly understand the particular mindset. I’m curious.What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind?Kyle: I think the most important thing for me is the fact that I was always real like that I always kept everything real I didn’t sugarcoat anything. I didn’t pretend to be somebody that I’m not. Like I just was always open and honest and true to who I am.The things that bug the hell out of me is just when you see people trying to you know pretend they’re somebody that they’re not. I never want to be that person. I want to be known as the person who always pushed and put everything he got on the table day in and day out. Whether the result was being number 1 or not and that not important to me as knowing inside that I left it all on the table.Mike: So Last question for you. What would you tell that agent or that broker listening to this podcast that was thinking out moving to EXP or just knew a better way to do business?Kyle I would only say that there’s really two brokerages that are going to thrive and they are the 100% shops where you can go and pay a flat fee per transaction or you can pay “X” dollars a year and do unlimited transactions. Those guys are going to do really well as the market corrects and then you got EXP. So people are going to have to make a decision.You want to go to the 100% where you basically have a name penned on a contract and really not much of anything else. There are not providing you a whole lot of system and not giving you whole lot of hands on training you with other agents when opportunities comes. It’s like Fisbo shops. Is the fisbo doing it in the cheapest way possible or they saving some money on the commission. Absolutely. But are they putting the most money in the pocket? Definitely not. And I look at EXP as a fisbo alternative where you do pay a small amount of fee and get massive value and fisbo knows that if they listed with us they’ll get massive value. Some fisbos are stubborn and they end up taking their own route.Looking at the statistics depending upon what statistics that you look at they are making around 10-20% less money in their pockets at the end of the day and I think agents will also see the same thing by going to the 100% shops and paying less to the brokerage but you are going leave a lot of money on the table just because opportunities like EXP were on the table providing you things on the front.To generate leads and manage those leads and turn them into contracts and you got things like Sky Slope help you manage those contracts and turn them into providing tools like that for you. Providing everything in the cloud which is amazing and the support is something that I wasn’t expecting.Right now if you’re in a brokerage you walk down the hall and see if your broker is there. You have to call that person and they don’t answer and they call you back and you miss it and you play phone tag or text tag. And that is so inefficient. At EXP, you just walk into a crowd and there’s a bunch of people that are just waiting to help you and you get real time support. The stock stuff is really great I mean the stocks and you pay attention what really happening and you get up listed to as STACK all that stuff and performing really well and seeing the future of the stock.The revenue share, I have seen people in this company that make about a million or a million and half just on revenue sharing where they sell a house or not that’s an insane opportunity where most brokerages where you help recruit somebody in your company and they take you out for dinner or something and that’s it. With this you can build generational wealth for yourself and pass it on to your kids. The opportunities what they are providing is just insane is because they are helping you *********** some real state and giving you intuitional ways to support yourself and your family so if you’re thinking about doing it do it now and don’t wait if you’re looking at this as a nine inning baseball game then we are at the first or second inning. We know that this company is going to break a hundred thousand and 200 thousand agents and if you’re going to be set early then your chances of success is more. And there are another 100 thousand agents who are going to join under a sponsor. Why not that sponsor be you?           Why be agent 200’000 when you can be agent 12000?And help spread the word about this company, build this massive revenue share for this massive revenue share and passive income that going to support you for the time to come.Mike: I love it man. I could not agree more with you about the opportunity it is huge I think we are roughly 11,600 agents now and you can only imagine the type of opportunity that’s out there.There are 2 kinds of agents out there right now. There are agents who get it and there are agents who are going to get it and the agents who get it right now obviously have the biggest opportunity when you talk about revenue share and stock awards and that’s why we want to be part of the early adapters and that’s why we joined EXP and brought our team over.Thank you so much for just being a part of what we are doing here today at agent revolution and its truly been a pleasure to talk to you and you definitely drop some knowledge out there and how can people connectKyle: The best way to connect with that we have started a FB page “Whissle Way” where people put questions and its answered in a group format rather than me answering the questions in a one on one format. So that way if someone has a question about how we do our open houses and they ask a question and everyone in the group can learn from it and I find that a much better way to go. We share stuff there from our meeting, snippets, tools and the fun stuff they are working. So I’m capped out on FB and I can’t add anyone there. Or Follow me on Instagram.Mike: Ok the Whissle way on facebook. And we will definitely connect with you there. Thank you being part of the show today and man you’re the best.Kyle: Cool man. thanks Dude.Mike: Wow! That was pretty fun, Kyle was amazing, I so admire the culture he has built and how he has just crushed it in San diago.Hey if you know someone who might enjoy the podcast share it with them and if you like the podcast.

Jay Kinder, Former #1 Coldwell Banker Agent and Real Estate Industry Icon Reveals Why He Joined eXp Realty and how has the transition worked out for him and his team. He believes that this is going to be a ride that is going to open up new doors and opportunities and experiences not just across the country but across the world with more than 1 million agents.Click here to listen to the podcast. Read the complete transcript below.This is the agent revolution podcast the next evolution of the real estate industry.Let’s get started.Mike: Here we go again with another episode of The Agent revolution podcast. Every week we sit down with the top agents across the country who have seen this amazing opportunity to grow with EXP. As always, I’m your host EXP mega agent Mike Wall super stocked today sitting down with one of my personal mentors and industry icon Jay Kinder.Jay was the number two agent in the world for Coldwell Banker. Today we will discuss about the time when he realized that he had found something really special and what ultimately pushed him over the edge to join EXP.Thank you so much for gracing us with your presence this morning. I appreciate you being here.This is extra special for me because you know you are one of my mentors and were kind of my mentor from afar when I got into to real estate.Just a quick story on Mr. Kinder. Jay, I don’t know if you remember this man but I remember sending you a certified letter talking about where I was at and then where I was hoping to go, and that you had me back up on Twitter saying the letter was what was a good look and I so appreciate that and I’ll never forget that. But man thank you so much for joining us. I’m hoping that we can really deliver some value today.Jay: Absolutely man. And now about that letter I really appreciate that. When you do what we do and try to help agents grow their business you never know who you’re going to talk to or whose path you’re going to cross. But it means a lot to me that when somebody said or shared something and that really made impact. And thank you so much for that. It was something I have to say, I found it the other day and it stays close to my desk because it was really a meaningful letter to me so I really appreciate you sharing that with me.Mike: That’s awesome man. Well let’s get started. I just created this agent revolution podcast because I think that every agent has their own unique story as it relates to their move to EXP. And I want to talk a little bit about the psychology that each agent goes through. Today I was thinking that’s what we would do. I mean if someone had been hiding under a rock for the last ten years and they don’t know who you are. How long have you been in real estate now Jay?Jay: Two decades. I was licensed in 1997 when I was 19 years old, that’s when I got into a real estate and learned a lot since then. And so, this 20th year actually marks the first year my 20-year-old son is in real estate. So kind of a couple of milestones there.Mike: That’s awesome man. How did you how did you end up getting into real estate?Jay: Yeah that’s a great question. At the age I was going to college, I went for a couple semesters, I wasn’t really on a path to anywhere in particular prior to getting into real estate. I made yards for my dad, actually my dad is in real estate. He owned a property management company and he bought Cole banker in 1997. He got in in 1977, the year I was born. And so, he’s been selling real estate forever. It seemed like a natural progression to get into real estate, he actually sent me to the Dale Carnegie course and at that point I started really leaning on kind of my mentor from afar kind of my mentor from afar maybe getting a real estate license and so what I decided to do was basically follow my dad into the industry somewhat blindly but it was a pretty exciting time.Mike: That’s awesome. So, let me ask you this. How is your business and your how was your business? How was your brokerage structured before you actually made to move to EXP?Jay: That’s a really good question Mike. Probably it won’t make sense to everybody. There’s going to be obviously a lot of advance people listening to this podcast. I know the circles that we all run in and there’s going to be some advance people. It’s all I’ll answer the question but it took a lot a lot of evolution right to get to this point where we were still trying to evolve the model. And for us we had you know we had both my reason I’m my business partner we had both had successful real estate practices for years and we stepped down. I stepped out I went independent in 2011 and you know Michael left Keller Williams at some point in there. And we both had been successful. We are number two in the Coldwell Banker. Mike was top 50 in the world or whatever for you know for Keller Williams, you get to a point and I think most people that we’ve coached over the years and we’ve all got to a point where you’re paying somebody whether it’s Coldwell or Keller or whoever you’re paying them you know we pay them more than 70 thousand dollars.It becomes a priority to go independent and just because you’re paying too much money and that there’s not enough value for whatever the brand is that you’re at.  Our path has been that and we’d coached a lot of people through that as we had some of these mass groups with a lot of the top agents around the country doing from you know an average of about a million and a half GCI on upwards. We were really trying to do something that we could take and scale across the country.So in 2014 we started the brokerage and we had dialed in the systems and processes so well we felt like a salary model we could deliver on a salary model so we had salaried agents and what we realized was that the number one in that business model is your compensation drive behavior. So even though we had the systems and processes it was management heavy and it was expensive to try to scale something like that.When you’re not there every day as we all know that you’re not there managing those people. You don’t have a hard time finding the right person to manage and lead at the level that you can lead it. So we quickly abandoned that strategy although it was very profitable it just wasn’t something that we wanted to do all day every day because it was going to require our presence. We wanted something that will allow us to step away more from it and scale and do something fun, not something that was just going to take us deeper in the trenches of the organization.We kind of abandoned that in 2014 and in 2015 we were basically Michael as a part of you know NIA and that that that company has been doing really well and that coaching training and all that. But we wanted to are really ramping up this this model and we did it through outbound sales and the promise this what we were trying to do.I think everyone will grasp that this was we were tired of working with agents that were on our team that were not built like we were. They’re not going to make the calls like we would call they were or not they just weren’t wired the way we’re wired. Every time we do have an agent like that they end up leaving us.So that was show that was kind of the motivation was to kind of level up on the agent that we were bringing on.So we wanted to make a promise which again if doesn’t solve the problem of adding value to the agent in your organization then it’s not going to work.So we knew that we had the chops if you will to deliver on marketing and Bill helping someone build their personal brand in a marketplace. So we would start we actually care about territories across all of Dallas. We also did it in Atlanta and we carved out the territories and we reverse engineered a marketing plan to go help them become the dominant agent in their marketplace with the goal of hitting 3 percent market share, focused on four listings a month. So our promise was ‘hey listen we’re going to get you to four listings per month “inbound but we were using out an outbound strategy of marketing and branding and things of that nature to generate those opportunities cultivate follow up and then ultimately deliver qualified appointments listing of appointments to these agents. Well that worked really well that sound that’s a really good offer. Okay so when you think about in terms of you know what an agent might agree to.We were able to get a high caliber agent to buy that and actually pay us 10000 dollars to join the brokerage which is really what funded the first 30 to 60 days of that campaign.You know we had a whole room full of you know it you know inside sales agents and we had to have a rock star that we had to put on that was managing those people. Michael wrote the book on sales predictability. They iterated on this for an entire year. Crazy thing was it worked. It worked really well. We ended up selling 274 homes and are 272 homes that for 12 months while hiring other ISAs, while building the technology to deliver on it and that was it me from you know again I was involved in the business model I was running.So this was kind of a don’t sell pilot that was out run and on its own and we funded it for that entire year and it was amazing to see what Michael had done. I mean it was just incredible to see you know something build up that fast in the marketplace. I mean I’ve never seen a company go from zero to 270 deals in one year. So it was just it was it was exciting to see what was going on. But as far as thinking about scaling that we still ran into the problem with these agents not being happy about the splits at 50/50 even though we were doing all this marketing and super complex and you know to put in place and in all these.I’d say they had to be managed and they didn’t have to make the call they needed to show up and get the listing. So like. And then they still were complaining about the split. We’re like gosh! dang it! I mean we still have a problem with the splits. You know then this is just going to be an uphill battle. So you know as heavy as that was the next year we decided you know what. Let’s you know let’s level well up one more time and see if we can get a little bit better. Agent will have the services but we’ll just have an ala carte and let them purchase again. We’re just trying to solve the same problem everybody else trying to solve. We iterate on your business model over and over and over.So you think you’ve got it right, so this round we had a guy that was running the brokerage Alex Piak who’s with EXP.He just felt like we didn’t have the right caliber agents. We still were not dealing with business people like us that we wanted to like it. If you’re going to spend the rest your life, do anything which is what we ask.Alex you know well he would want to be doing if it would be run in a brokerage and he was like man there’s some good agents we had on board. You know but. But you know the best ones you know. You know there’s only a handful like two is the same is our typical ratio.Right you get 10 agents which we had about 10 or 12 and only 2 we really liked them that we would be stay partners forever. Then we had the rest of them that we would actually rather never work with for the most part.So anyways that that we one more year goes by as we start doing that and we’re finding agents on a little bit higher splits have a graduated split just trying to you know just iterate on what’s the best model. No different than probably everybody in the world is tried to do and we still don’t solve the problem of how you add the most. The agent would never leave you. You can really track top tier talent there just wasn’t anything like it that we’d seen and then you know EXP comes on the radar and you know you go through the typical stages always you asking the question I don’t know where to go.That was our transition right.I mean that’s it really I mean we were discussing iterate relentlessly iterating on a broken model. I mean that’s what it felt like. And I mean nobody is going as much money and added as we were because as we were trying and coaching and training people on you know there you know a lot of high level people on where you should be taking this thing.How do you step out of this thing? Are you going to sell your business? I think that’s lie that we were telling ourselves. We had an asset that we can sell. You know the reality is it’s one of the reasons.Even so you got to stay in it for a year two or three. So there really is no value right there and to pay you with your own money. If anybody comes along to buy it and then you step out. It’s really questionable that whether or not it’s going to stand on its own two feet. I would argue that for most of us it would not. So that was the reality of where we’re at and then you know then all of a sudden new model shows up.Mike: Man I got to ask you like so tell me when you first heard about the EXP what was your reaction? What was the thought process? if you brushed it off or I mean tell me a little bit about that.Jay: Yeah so yeah. So there were three interactions that where EXP was brought up to me one time it was brought to me and it was somebody that my Lindor in Oklahoma and I was actually at an Oklahoma Ohio State game. I was there with my son. My middle son and a guy named Neal Blewett from Ohio. Alma was was introducing me to a guy who lives in Oakland city now and he was there we win that game by the way.Now that this was the year before this project right. HEADLEE. You’re right. We actually did lose Magnitogorsk they’ll thump us at home. You’re right we waited till next year until Baker Racheal. Exactly.So yeah this was the year when we lost and to Ohio sorry over there. Well right now it’s good. I was always like we won though we lost that game. So he was telling me about it. I just totally ignore it. I mean he was talking about Stockham and my only take away from this guy who was like ridiculously excited about this company that never heard of and was my biggest takeaway was I’ve never had an agent come up to me so excited about his company.My takeaway was he didn’t say they are redish or anything like that. He just talked about the stock Greg showed me that aren’t spoiling anything else. I was like man you’ve got to have ownership as a part of your business model at the time. It was my take away because I was looking we had a business model, I got a vision, I got 40 employees plus the brokerage and all of the team.I was like I was trying to join some brokers. That’s for sure. So I was just hearing what was working in the business model, I ignored it. I didn’t look into it at all. it had been maybe four or five months later. I actually got a call from Chris Waters who’s not a part of EXP. He’s franchised on his business right now. I couldn’t protect that right.Yeah. Number one agent in Austin Texas. I mean I personally coached him on because at the time I wasn’t doing a lot of coaching but I had him when he was doing about 40 transaction. He’s you know whatever he’s doing now he’s Net Net million or two.He asks me to look at the model and I thought he was in it to me not really endorsing if he really said anything about the model it’s because he saw the model. This is real and I listened to his his interpretation he was asking questions about the calculators, about other things that was like this stuff.No I don’t see the numbers on this because this is real. I’m not sure. I mean it can be really impressive but I think he kind of wrote it off. Right. So I kind of took same kind of position but had our CFO all the time on the airplane we were flying somewhere and I was like man I need you to take a look at this man I said this. This is this might be the model right. It really might be the model.It was drastically different than what we had been doing. Coming from you know high Kyron I say and all the heavy lifting that we were doing to try to deliver more value to the agent and to get them to stay again.You’re trying to really solve the recruiting and attrition challenge. So that was the problem we were trying to solve. You know when we were looking at how we might implement this. The timing wasn’t right at that moment and as excited as I got.I kind of just wrote it off and it wasn’t the right time. Sometimes I think we all run into at different times in a lot of people come back to it when the time is right and they come on board. And we were kind of in that situation and it wasn’t until Al Stasek, a great friend of mine really our number one client. If you were to say terms of influence and just you know just a good dude relationship wise and everything else.And he’s one of our best friends we have found at our home and we had last week video.I’ve been on multiple calls with our and people like Andrew and Al.We were trying to put together what’s ownership opportunity or something where there’s some savings for your agents. Something that you can get a chance to have some real value for them at the end of their career. Most of our agents don’t have much. They barely can save to pay their taxes much less for the rest of their lives and invest that in a way that’s going to be meaningful.We didn’t have anything like that as well. Al was just really diligent about trying to solve that because he was losing top agents, leaving and things like that and at the time actually he wasn’t losing agents it was just his motivation was we need to do something that guys who are agents. what would that look like he was trying to figure that out?Well he got pretty excited about it but he didn’t ask me about it for months. He looked at it and making good decisions by going to different people never brought it up to me and then on Riggs my 4 year old as it was his fourth birthday he hits me up and he wants to talk through it. He asked me if I would poke holes in it. I spent four hours pacing back and forth in my backyard with my wife peering out the window at me. I just didn’t have any real holes because you want to remain open minded and be open but I’m talking to my number one guy.When he brought it up, the brokerage was in another direction. It was a big deal for me to understand what he was really doing and why?neither were losing him is like a planner or anything like that but it was it was definitely a different step in a direction that we worked on Zope that was just you know we wanted to understand it.So it took him a little while to kind of try. It didn’t really take me long to get it done. I mean once I saw it again I realized this really does solve the problem. If it’s real and about you know if I can meet the executive team and believe in the people behind it because I didn’t know them then you know then this thing has a shot. I mean this could be a game changer, I know because I didn’t see that disrupting the brokerage side. I always thought it was going to be disrupting the consumer side. I always thought of disruption was going to disrupt the consumer. If that was going to happen by now I just feel like it would have happened. I mean I’ve been saying that since 2008 or 2012 as we found it in an e-mail because we felt like you need to be positioned as an expert in the marketplace which we still do because we could. If somebody was going to disrupt and nobody has so that was just you know a big aha for me.Mike: Did you ever think somebody would come up with a model that would allow you to recruit top agents to your team? I mean think about is this expansion on a grand scale.Jay: Oh yeah. it is.The more you get to know the founder and spend time with him and his thinking that guy sees around a corner. It was in Stanford 2007, we had multiple teams across the country. That’s back when if you think about it that’s back when we first started really doing Legion you know I’m saying like like Legian was in 2007 I think when the iPhone came out. I’m saying it’s a long time ago which doesn’t seem so long. Back when me and Mike used to fly around the country. We would make bets as to how many leads we’d have in our inbox when we landed. So like to have multiple teams across the country and be trying to solve that problem then he was really a fore thinker as it was he was expansion before expansion existed and so it was really interesting to hear that story because I go back to 07 all I remember is pain and agony.You know that those times you know he’s Galen’s something across the country and really growing during a time where I think we’re all trying to figure out yourselves an Oreo just to save our careers back then. You know so that was.Yeah. I never saw that coming. I just didn’t see what he saw.Mike: Yeah. We were just looking in a different direction and that really was all it was about. So I guess you know the climax here then is this what was it that Ben actually pushed you over the edge that said you know what. This is what we’re going to do man. And you never look back yes.Jay: So for me there’s always a couple of things that drive me. The first thing is like I’ve always said that how do we put our fires together make one big fire. I’ve always wanted to work with people like you Mike and people like Al and the great team that we built here at EXP that are getting to work together on a regular basis to do something big right and help each other and work together and like all the efforts and things that we’ve created over the years we can use the leverage to help agents grow their businesses EXP and help them to tell their friends about joining the EXP.That’s a pretty cool thing to be able to do. But for me it’s always about where am I going to make the biggest impact? How am I going to be able to add the most value to the most people? That’s kind of where I’m always looking to go.I really think we all have ego so you’re always wrestling with it in one capacity or another. A lot of people the only reason they are not at EXP is Ego. I am lucky to not be one of those people because you know I had to really swallow my ego and you know to go tell 40 employees that this is the new direction we’re going after.You know all day you’re going to go do you have a clear vision and all a sudden something impacts you so much that it makes you make a hard right turn. I think the collaboration for me was a big deal with the people that I want to be able to work with.Obviously the opportunity here far surpasses anything that I’ve ever seen in my life time. Whereas you can hang your license at any real estate brokers. There’s rarely an opportunity like I’ve seen here. For me that’s a big deal. You know it fits for people that want to do something bigger than just sell real estate and they want to make it big on people’s lives which is why a lot of the top agents are making this move. We’re joining forces and linking arms together to help grow this company and make it really make a deal in the real estate universe anyway.Mike: Yeah. So you are making a huge impact and I think it is truly exciting to be a part of not only what the EXP is doing but what you’re doing. I think one of the things that we all think is what type of legacy are we going to lead?Not only in our personal lives but in our professional lives. And so for you. What kind of a legacy do you wish to leave behind?Jay: I really just want to say what I can and let other’s know about the experience and touch and help as many people as I can. I could possibly have an impact on people. They saying that I changed my business, changed my paradigm or I really learned something or you made a difference in my life.That’s really it for me. You know the more of an impact I can make on the most amount of people. I’m always moving in that direction and there’s not a definitive number for me that is I’ve got to get to this day I’ve been impacted but I feel like in this company I’m just a good fit for that.Being able to have the freedom to add value and try to help more real estate agents find success and not be miserable. I think that they are either struggling to find success or they find the success and then it becomes the struggle in and of itself you know that was what really drove me right like I spent the first 10 years of my career working harder.Being away from my family and not having the freedom that I was seeking. That became the point when I decided I was going the rest of my life. I’m hoping agents to not have to to have those struggles. And you know trying to fix a broken industry. And I think this business model gives the flexibility to do you know to build a business that has more than just wake up every day go do it again type of mentality and work and every evening and every weekend it gives you the ability to build something that has some real substance and long term benefit and no passive income opportunity which doesn’t exist in any other business.Mike: Yeah, you can just feel it every day. The excitement in just talking to you it’s just palpable. There’s so much opportunity, it’s just I mean I don’t know about you but you know for me. Every day I get out of bed and I’m excited about you know a new opportunity a new place that I can go and my business that you know kind of makes me feel like I did when I first got it and all that excitement of not knowing but knowing where we could go and I’ve got to tell you it is just.I’m just I feel blessed I feel excited.I I’m excited about where we’re going. I’m excited for our team and the opportunity that now we’ve given them to move forward. Here we are you know today and so for you. So what is the vision now? What’s down the road?Jay: Yeah I think we know, it’s one team one dream but I think in terms of the people that are directly brought in. There’s someone that’s kind of our revenue sharing group. I’d like to see a hundred thousand agents across the company.I believe this company’s going to have well more than a million agents and again this is a global company and we haven’t opened in all of the other countries but they’re quickly finishing up Canada and I think we’re one or two states away in the United States. There’s people beating down our door in Australia, Mexico and there are bullies everywhere you go. Where it’s going next and I’ve never had people in my downline and in Australia I don’t know.People know little about how that was sold and done in Australia not that much different than us. But you that’s where this thing is going.This is going to be a ride that is going to open up new doors and opportunities and experiences not just across the country but across the world. So I’m excited to see what that’s going to look like.My goal is to continue you need to know to bring awareness to you know people across the country they’re selling real estate and make them aware of this opportunity and how working together is going to be better than them trying to figure things out on their own and come and join to join this great ride industry. This great company with us.Mike: Yeah man absolutely. Absolutely. What would you tell an agent or even a who owns their own company? So what would you tell them. Someone that was listening to this podcast that just knew there was a better way to do business and they were thinking about making a move either to another brokerage or to EXP.Jay: I would tell them to reach out to you. Number one since they’re listening to your podcasts. I would say you need to reach out to Mike Wall, ask him some questions. You need to get clear on what all of this is about and understand what I always like to do when I’m having a conversation with someone to ask them where you’re at? where you’re trying to go?You don’t tend to know where you want to be in the next five years or 10 years. Are you on a path that you believe is going there. The answer for most people is really is a grind and either you have a lot of pain in your business model or you don’t but I can tell you this if feels like and I can’t predict a downturn but it feels like 05/06 which for me were the two best years in real estate where I didn’t have pain associated with 07/08. So when there’s a downturn, when we think about the next 5 10 years, when you’re building and you may be on the upside right now you don’t know what’s it going to look like.You know downright these are models are going to survive that and are you 100 percent sure that what you’re doing is really going to work and it’s going to get better? Are you going to solve the problem? Improve it?When you get real clear on where you’re out where you want to go there’s very few if any conversations that I’ve had that it didn’t make sense for you to be aligned with EXP to get there.1 or 2 years of company was the goal as opposed to maybe I can do this in five to 10 years so that’s the thinking that I like to get people into. You seek truth. I don’t try to defend your position, defend your business model, defend your decisions that you’ve made the last 10 years. You know you don’t mean anything. Let go of all that and just be open minded and don’t listen through a filter and be open to him and you know there’s a lot of really smart people that are making this move.Let me see if I seek to understand what am I missing. Or the that’s right questions that you should be asked.Mike: Get out of judgment get into curiosity.Well Jay. It’s truly been a pleasure to have you on the show man. You are a true icon in the real estate industry. You’ve given so much and I wish you the best.Jay appreciate you as always man and we’ll talk again soon.Jay: Sure.Mike: So that concludes my conversation with industry icon Jay Kinder. Jay always delivers big value and he’s so much fun to talk to you.Hey if you know someone you think might enjoy the podcast please share it with them if you like the podcast please go wherever you listen to the podcast and subscribe if you’re curious about what you can do for you and your business.

        "content": "In real estate, if you wait until December or January to start planning for the next year, you’ll be at least 30 to 45 days behind the eight ball.As you know, when we put a home under contract, the typical turnaround time is 30 to 45 days. This is why I have all my team members making their business plans now in October—so we all have a roadmap for 2019.In making this roadmap, I have them submit their income goal for the year, and they work backward from that number. They need to know the number of buyers and sellers they’ll work with, the number of appointments they’ll be on, and the listings they’re taking in order to hit that goal. To calculate the exact numbers, I created a spreadsheet based on an economic model I acquired at a former brokerage, and in the video above I’ll show you how it works.“If you want to be successful in real estate, you need a business plan.”For your convenience, I’ve attached timestamps of the video so you can reference each key point:  3:58 - A sample economic worksheet.  7:23 - How many weekly, monthly, and yearly buyer listing appointments you can expect from a $100,000 income goal with a 50/50 split between buyer and sellers.  10:33 - The daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly conversion ratios for these appointments.  12:38 - The same conversion ratios from the seller side.  14:32 - How many seller appointments, listings taken, and sales you’ll need to make $100,000 in a year.If you want to be successful in real estate, you need a business plan. If you don’t know where you’re going, you’ll never know where to start, so your first step should be to have an income goal for 2019. Having an income goal in mind and a spreadsheet like the one my team has makes everything easier. You know what to do to hit your goal, and you know what to do to get back on track if you fall behind.If you’re interested in building a business plan or you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.",

        "content": "This Podcast highlights the problems faced by independent brokerages and team leaders across the States. The challenge of recruitment and retention is still prevailing in many business models. Al Stasek, Cleveland Rock star agent and team leader who switched over to EXP explains how the EXP model helped him to overcome these problems and how EXP is growing organically.Click here to listen to the podcast. Read the complete transcript below.Mike: This is the Agent revolution podcast. The next evolution of the real estate industry. Let’s get started. What’s up. Welcome to another dose of the agent revolution podcast where each week we dive deep with mega agents around the globe who transition their business to EXP and absolutely crushing it. I’m your host EXP mega agent Mike Wall.Today we’re sitting down with Cleveland Rock star agent and team leader Al Stasek. Al and I are talking about his journey to EXP, shutting down his already thriving independent brokerage to join EXP. Why did it? How did he broke into his team? And how they’re selling more real estate than ever before.Please welcome Al Stasek.Al: What’s up Mike? How are you doing? Thanks for having me on.Mike: I am doing good brother. Appreciate you being my first victim today. I appreciate that. And really I just wanted to create this platform you know for every agent out there who either joined EXP or looking to join EXP.Every agent has a story to tell. Every agent has a reason why they are joining or are thinking about joining EXP. I just wanted to provide a platform for agents like yourself to come on and talk to other agents and kind of tell their stories.You and I know each other and we run in the same circle and obviously have some of the same contacts. And I know you I guess on a surface level but you know how you been in real estate Al?Al: Well, it’s 2018, and so that would be August will be my 20th year. So, yeah it’s been a long time. My dad is a real estate broker. He did it part-time as we grew up. So I grew up in real estate offices going up to the real estate offices.Watching my dad hustle, do his thing and that made me not want to be in real estate. You know watching what he did and making cold calls, and I mean times were just different then. There was no internet. You didn’t do real estate online as we do it now. It was a grind, and you to drive everywhere to get signatures and it was just it was just different. I didn’t want anything to do with it.But here I am 20 years in the business, loving it and couldn’t see myself doing anything else. And a lot of that is because of the EXP model and what that platform has allowed me to do and grow. So, yeah 20 Years.Mike: That’s awesome man. This whole EXP model has just reinvigorated me, my real estate career and I’m sure in talking to you, it has done the same for you. And most people that we speak to it’s like a big awakening where we’re just enjoying ourselves again.Al: Yes, we are having fun. I am an entrepreneur. I run three companies. And so do you do. So, I mean every morning I huddle with my respective teams from the different companies and every morning I can say this and I wasn’t able to answer this a few years ago even when our business was booming where I am having the most fun I’ve ever had in this business for 20 years.And that says a lot because I’ve had some pleasure in the past and we’ve made lots of money and sold lots of houses and he could get to a point your career where it has to be a little bit about building something more than that you know, and that’s kind of how I feel about the opportunity with the EXP and why I saw it and then I just you know I couldn’t really unsee it in fact.This coming month June here marks my one-year anniversary where I saw the model. It was June of last year when I allowed myself to see it because I ignored this thing for like a year.(Mike Laughs)Mike: Yeah, I am excited to dig into that part of it man. How is your business? How’s your team structured? You run a real estate team, you have agents that work underneath you.You transitioned over from a brokerage that you were running yourselves? Is that correct?Al: Yep, we were a brokerage. It was the team model basically, and we were trying to do some tweaks with the model to fix a few of the things that EXP model corrected. And that’s kind of why this is all kind of happened the way it did.We were the number one Remax team in our market for a while. In 2013 I broke off and we were about the write Remax a six-figure check in fees if I didn’t leave in 2013. Luckily my dad at his brokerage license and I paid him a fraction of the amount to be the broker, and I just kept running my business with my dad.So, after four years, we doubled. But I still had two pretty big problems. One of them was recruiting, and the other one was retention. And you know like I was continually training my competition, and they would leave to go to Keller Williams. So, I just wanted to give them more opportunity like a piece of the company, and we were even trying to figure out ways of doing that. And we just kept falling. We had great intentions and lots of good ideas but we were not able to execute.Mike: Yeah, I completely understand that so we’ll unpack that just a little bit. You spoke about your recruiting and retention. How do you think that you know since making the transition that you saw for EXP is helping to solve that whole recruiting issue?Al: Well, the thing is I never liked recruiting, never. I was more relational versus going out and just trying to knock down appointments to meet with agents. That for me didn’t feel natural. So I didn’t do it. When I was building my real estate business, I equated many tasks early in my career; didn’t care or didn’t like it, but did it anyway. Then I got to a point where I was getting a lot of referral business. I was still doing marketing because I could afford to do different marketing but I always prefer attracting versus chasing even though I did my fair chase. Who doesn’t?You know Mike, you would agree you’d indeed attract business as well. But I felt the same way about recruiting. I didn’t want to go out and chase it because I was always being chased like you. You probably were being chased by other brokers. And so I didn’t like that. Thus for me, I’m now attracting great people because of the model. And I joke with Kinder all the time and be like well “I didn’t all of a sudden get nicer or cooler or anything”. I’m the same leader that I’ve always been. I feel like I lead with my heart in the right place. I have a better model that I’m leading.It’s attracting versus me going out and having to chase. And that’s right up my alley. That’s why this to me. After of course I shot some holes in it and it seemed like a no-brainer to me.Mike: Well let’s be honest you are a little bit cooler since you came EXP.(Al Laughs)Al: Alright! Well I’ll take that. I’ll take that. Thank you sir. So are you.Mike: Appreciate it. So you talked about this whole recruiting issue. You can talk to team leaders all across the United States who feel the same way we do about recruiting. It is I would say top 1, 2 or 3 of the most significant challenges that team leaders have in a growing real estate business.So, EXP to some extent has solved that as it relates to the type of people you are attracting and in the offering that you have. So talk a little bit about your group, your specific group and maybe some of the different components that excited them when you decided to join EXP.Al: Well I mean with the group that I believe you’re talking about is Mike and Jay who are my friends and your friends as well. I ended up entering into a business partnership based on the EXP opportunity. And so we’ve been growing that out. It’s been an absolute blast. We’re attracting other high-level, high thinking people who are entrepreneurial like yourself.So I would break it into a couple of different categories. Mike to be honest I mean we are attracting what Che calls the badasses. You know these are guys that have sold houses, they’ve ran teams, they were leaders. They’ve even head coaching companies, and training companies and these people love dropping value in the real estate world for real estate agents.They’re either running very successful brokerages, they’re great at Legionary, and they’re just leaders. So, they’re attracting that group I would put together as the “entrepreneurial business owners”.Then we have the people who love selling real estate, not that the first group doesn’t. Its just that these people don’t have big teams. These people are agents who you know they might be sold a few houses a year, and they love it. They love the business, they love taking care of their clients, but they’re not out there trying to make significant work. We’re tracking those types of folks as well. So what’s beautiful is the marriage between the two. It’s great as it gives agents an option.They can hop on one of these teams that are operating in a super high level or they come just come and join EXP and still get some support not only with the team environment. They are given options, and that was the biggest Ah ha I saw in probably the most significant nudge that I had where now I can talk to people about options.I had a girl in my office right before we hopped on today. And that’s that was this exact conversation she’s leaving for another brokerage for multiple reasons. And then I said here are your two options, join Stesek group. And here’s how it looks like. Or you can join EXP on your own and here’s what that will look like. I can try to help you build your team just like I did. This option didn’t exist in the independent model that I left.Mike: Yeah and either way you win right.Al: Either way, we win. Everybody wins but it boils down to the point that I can work with more people because I’m meeting them where they’re at their business and they don’t meet me at my turf. You know one size does not fit all of them. This opens the opportunity for that young lady who just left.She may think “You know what I think Stesek group is where I want to grow my business.” And I think that’s the opportunity I need to look at building my business that way for now. She may leave and say I’m inspired by what you did and this is going to help me. Then I set up a schedule and get on a call with some of my folks on a regular basis to check in with them.There’s no coaching. They don’t have to sign a coaching agreement. Not indefinite. I don’t have enough time for everybody. However, the people I bring onboard, I love helping them grow their business because we are aligned to the opportunity.Mike: Yeah, that’s just amazing, the mindset that you have because you know we work the same way. I mean we just sat down with somebody this morning as well and talked about the opportunity in our team and then also at EXP and then kind of compare and contrast.Like I said, now we have a system now that we’re building to start people out on our team and graduate them to be an independent EXP agent if they want to do that. And what’s great is we’re training them to do real estate the right way just like you are and then you know there’s an opportunity for revenue sharing not only for us but for them because we’re teaching them. Then to go out and teach others how to recruit and train.Al: Yeah, I love it, helping them build their teams Vs you are building your team because I didn’t have any incentive about helping anyone else develop their team when I was an independent broker unless of course there with my brokerage and I didn’t have an ownership option.The option to give shares of my company away wasn’t there. So, it was tough to attract people to that model. I’m being honest. I coined myself the worst recruiter in the world because when I left Remax, I had about seven agents. I topped out at like 13 over four years so if you do the math, that doesn’t come at the top of the list of Head Recruiter.Mike: I think my biggest profit share check from KW was 368 dollars and it was June of last year. And I think my first revenue share check was over two grands. So, I mean it’s just amazing the type of business model that Glenn has set up for us. And like I said, every day I get out of bed and I’m excited to come into the office because I think you know people like you and me and other team leaders out there.You know they can change lives in this model provides more value than we previously offered. They talk about expansion, and the big thing when we were at KW was this whole expansion model.When you had to expand into another office, you had to get another camper, you had to pay you had to pay more fees, and now you can expand into any market anywhere in the United States and people essentially working with you on your team but they don’t have you on your team.Al: Right. Yeah. And we did that. And I’ll be honest Mike I never had the desire to run an expansion team. I just I know there were a ton of opportunities still in my town that you know I’m from Cleveland, you’re Ohio guy too. You’re down south and I’ve got the north border. I had to get a good enough market share before spreading out to others.What happened was I ended up in Boca Raton because I had two agents that needed the resources from my team. They didn’t have any money down there. They just moved down there to take another job. Long story short the husband ended up losing the position because the company got bought and he was downsized.He went got a real estate license. They didn’t know anybody down there. Imagine just dropping into a brand new market. So I was able to expand without trying to expand. It just you know again it’s attracting those expansion partners versus trying to chase them down. I still had no desire to do that, but I could help them. I could partner with them and help them grow their brand down there. And everybody wins.Mike: Yes Absolutely man! I want to touch on this definitely because I think it is an essential component of the conversation. You talked about when you first heard about the opportunity. Was it June of last year? What was your reaction when you heard of it? How was it when you joined?Al It was when I first saw it because for about a year. I coach real estate agents for a while right under Mike and Jay. When they asked me to become a coach. And I loved it. I met a lot of great people because of it. I kept good relationships with them even if I wasn’t coaching them any longer. I did stop coaching in 2016. I had too much on my plate.I still have good relationships, and some of these people who have joined EXP kept messaging me like “Al you gotta check this out.” And I my exact words were “George, I have my brokerage. I’m paying nobody anything. Why would I close my brokerage and go to pay somebody a cap” So that was just my stubbornness which didn’t let me look at the possibility that might be a better way out of this model.And I’m an Inman. I watch Inman News and I read the articles that come by and I see these new innovative models come by every day. And I’ll say not all of them have impressed me.Let me put it that way. So I was brushing these guys off. I even have good relations with them, and I did not believe them. I didn’t think they understood I had my brokerage so why would I? Why would I ever do that?Well, the truth of the matter is that if you have some problems in your business that you solve I think you have to think of what are all the ways you can solve them. While there are an infinite number of ways to solve problems right?  So if you’re not if you’re looking through a certain lens at how to fix these problems you might be actually. That’s what I was doing.I was figuring how I could fix these on my own. That was the lens I saw it through. The second I started looking through a different Lens saying “Okay let me look at this model and see.” I looked at it so I can get them off my back.Cliff my first real estate coach asked me to have a look at the model and I said - Look I’ll look at this just long enough to tell you “you’re nuts.” and then I’m out. Then you can stop bugging, and Cliff goes “yes please tell me if I’m crazy. “I was skimming my pool June of last year 2017. Then while skimming my pool, I decided to listen to it. So I listened to one of the webinars, and I heard it right away. Then I stopped skimming the pool, put the skimmer down, went inside the house and I watched a replay of that same webinar. I was like Wow. This solves the two most significant problems that I have in my model; retention and recruiting.From there, I took a deep dive for 60 days. I started poking holes in it because I like something’s not right here. There has to be something I’m missing. Every night I couldn’t even sleep.However, I had a notepad next to my bed. I would be writing questions down that would pop in my mind so that I wouldn’t forget them because the next day I was about to make a call to somebody at EXP about that.The questions were: How abut this? What happened with that? And the more I did it, the more I know I found that these you know Glenn I’m not saying he thought of everything. Yeah at least in the questions I was asking to try and poke holes in it, he had it all covered!This wasn’t something that he just dreamed up one day and put together. This was one of the most well-thought-out business models I’ve ever seen. And you know the closer I got to that 60-day mark I was just like I am in. I told my team “Guys check this out. Tell me if I’m nuts”.Now it’s shoes on the other foot and my entire team. I found that it was better for my agents. EXP was able to give my agents more than I could provide as an independent broker and that was the big defining moment. When I saw their faces, and they were like, Heck yeah! we gave them this opportunity. I get stock, I can help you grow it, and get compensated for helping you grow it.It was a no-brainer, and there wasn’t an agent who didn’t come over. Every single one came to EXP and we’ve been just having a blast.Mike: That’s awesome. OK, so the timeline was that 60 days later you were talking to your team about moving?Al: Well, I didn’t wait 60 days to talk to the team. I have two leaders Joel and Colleen who sit in all my strategy meetings. They’re my trusted advisers that I go to if I have to make a business decision. So I first told them” You guys watch this and tell me what your thoughts are?” and I honestly thought that they were going to give me negative pushback.They were like wow this is amazing. So then I went down the line went to my next leader. This was a guy Dan who was with ReMax for 25 of his 30-year career in real estate. So this guy you know he’s an O.G. This guy knows he’s been in real estate you know not before I was born but you know a long time OK.And he was really behind the ReMax brand. He Loved it. So I thought I’d get some pushback from Dan. I did not. It just right down the line. Once all my leaders in the company all saw it, and they were all like yeah I think we need to explore this at the very minimum.They’re like well let’s not jump right away but let’s explore it make sure that this is for real. I did all that legwork, and then after 60 days, I left the rest of the team know. The newer agents took it well. Everyone was in.Mike: That’s awesome. That’s a great story. And you know we were in a similar position, and I was actually in the process of getting ready to open my own Keller Williams market center in between Dayton and Cincinnati and you know that’s when I found out about the opportunity.I did exactly what you did man. I tried to poke holes in it. You guys were very helpful in me and my team transition over. As we left kW, we brought our entire group over except one agent who is a part-time agent. And you know we just never look back and so like I’m glad you know we kind of share the same story in that regard.So let me ask you this. And you know obviously we’re going to draw to an end here. For the agents or team leaders or brokers out there listening right now what would you, what would be a piece of advice that you will give them to help them make the decision.Al: Well I mean I think it’s to get on the phone with you or myself or someone that they trust you know and really you know, Jaysus look at this with both eyes wide open. If you’re going to stay where you’re at, That’s fine.If you’re with a great company that’s awesome. But what I’ve been told a lot of people is look at wherever you’re at as a platform to grow your real estate business. I think it starts with mindset and changing people’s mindset that the reason they’re successful at Keller Williams it’s not because of Keller Williams. It’s because they’re a successful human being and they’re probably going to be successful at any shop whether there are at Remax, they would have been successful.That’s not to say that that different brokerages offer different value propositions because they do. What I am saying is don’t look at them as that, look at them as a platform. And when someone does business with someone, they’re doing it with that agent because there’s the relationship. And if they are going to refer that person back, they are not referring their broker, they are referring the agent.The agent is the brand. So, if we can agree that agents are the more important brand in the relationship then they have to look at the brokers as a platform they’re using to build their business. And it’s no more than that. Once we can agree on that, you look at the different platforms and say - Am I on the right platform? Is there an opportunity on this platform? Is this the best place to spend the next 5, 10 or 20 years of my career? As it’s a big deal where you decide to spend it.Especially when you see a fast growing company like this where you know when I joined Mike there were about 4000 agents last August. Nine months later there are 12000 agents, and that means it tripled from 4 to 8 to 12 in nine months.There’s a reason, and it’s not because we have good recruiters. That position does not exist in our company. You know whereas with I’m not that familiar with KW I know enough about it being dangerous but you’re about to open one so you know what are the positions that the most crucial place in a market center is the team leader. The team leader’s main priority is recruitment.Mike That’s all they do is recruit.Al: We just don’t have that position. And without the brick and mortar, we have less expenses and we’re growing quickly, but we’re growing quickly organically. We’re not going in buying the companies because that’s another way to grow. And I know Berkshire Hathaway is buying privately held companies and I’m not pooh poohing the idea. I mean it is what it is and they’ve got the cash to do it. But we’re growing at a faster rate than any other company in the United States organically which is really cool. So check it out that’s the advice I give.Mike: Absolutely brother. Thank you. Thank you so much for taking a couple minutes out of your day to day. Any way they can get hold of you?Al: Yeah, you can reach out to me @ alstasek@stasekgroup.com or you can hit me up on my cell.Mike: All right you heard it. Thanks so much man.Al: You’re welcome Mike. Thanks for having me on.Mike: All right. That was my conversation with Cleveland icon real estate agent Al Stasek.I just got some serious knowledge. I always love talking.
